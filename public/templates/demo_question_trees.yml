# As fine-grained annotation requires complex categories, many successful fine-grained 
# typologies organize their classification in trees. Our interface is unique in that it can 
# render any arbitrary annotation tree, no matter its depth or breath. We will begin with 
# simple annotation setups, and then showcase some complex examples.
