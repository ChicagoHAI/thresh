        "target": "The US Is Blatantly Telling Lies\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the Trump administration has a strong distaste for Iran.\nIran is one of the only issues on which the U.S. president has remained relatively consistent.\nTrump berated the country both before and after taking office.\nHowever, Trump\u2019s anti-Iran strategy goes against the better judgment of even the most anti-Iranian advisors in his staff who don\u2019t want to see the U.S. isolated on the world stage.\nFortunately for Trump, however, he is not alone in his bid to isolate and demonize Iran at all costs.\nOn December 12, Trump\u2019s ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, gave a grandiose speech demonizing Iran that echoed Colin Powell\u2019s infamous performance before the U.N. in 2003.\nHaley\u2019s essential claim was that Saudi Arabia is under attack by missiles supplied to Yemen by the Iranian government and that the world should not sit idly by as this goes on.\n\u201cIf we do nothing about the missiles fired at Saudi Arabia, we will not be able to stop the violence,\u201d Haley warned.\n\u201cThere is clear evidence that the missiles that landed on Saudi Arabia come from Iran,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe evidence is undeniable.\nThe weapons might as well have had \u2018Made in Iran\u2019 stickers all over it.\u201d\nBuy Gold at Discounted Prices\nHowever, even as Haley opened her mouth, many commentators could already identify a number of issues with her speech.\nAs Common Dream\u2019s Reza Marashi explained:\n\u201cHaley cited a UN report in her claim regarding Iranian missile transfers to the Houthis.\nOf course, the UN has reached no such conclusion.\nInstead, a panel of experts concluded that fired missile fragments show components from an Iranian company, but they have \u2018no evidence as to the identity of the broker or supplier.\u2019 Asked about Haley\u2019s claim that Iran is the culprit, Sweden\u2019s ambassador to the UN said, \u2018The info I have is less clear.\u2019 Analysts from the U.S. Department of Defense speaking to reporters at Haley\u2019s speech openly acknowledged that they do not know the missiles\u2019 origin.\nPerhaps most surreal is the very same UN report cited by Haley also says the missile included a component that was manufactured by an American company.\nDid she disingenuously omit that inconvenient bit from her remarks, or fail to read the entire UN report?\nThe world may never know.\u201d\nRegardless of the fact that Haley misrepresented the U.N. report in question, it appears the entire premise of the U.N. report is almost completely incorrect, anyway, according to former inspector Scott Ritter.\nRitter writes:\n\u201cThe missile debris in question actually contradicts the finding of the UN panel, which held that the missiles launched against Saudi Arabia had been transferred to Yemen in pieces and assembled there by Houthi missile engineers; it is clear that the missiles in question had been in the possession of Yemen well before the Saudi Arabian-led intervention of 2015, and that their source was either Soviet or North Korean.\nThe modification kits, on the other hand, appear to be of Iranian origin, and were transported to Yemen via Oman.\nThe UN panel claims not to have any evidence of \u2018external missile specialists\u2019 working alongside the Houthi; indeed, the simplicity of the Burkhan 2-H modification concept is such that anyone already familiar with the SCUD-B missile system would be able to implement the required processes without outside assistance.\u201d [emphasis added]\nSo where did the missiles come from, and who made them?\nAccording to Ritter:\n\u201cRather than the Iranian-manufactured Qiam-1 missiles Haley and the Saudi Arabian government claimed, the debris presented by Haley were of a modified Soviet-manufactured SCUD-B missile; the airframe and engine are original Soviet-made components, and many of the smaller parts on display bear Cyrillic (i.e., Russian) markings.\nThe transformation to the Burkhan 2-H design required the Houthi engineers to increase the size of the fuel and oxidizer tanks, and lengthen the airframe accordingly.\nThis is done by cutting the airframe, and welding in place the appropriate segments (this also required that the fuel supply pipe, which passes through the oxidizer tank, be similarly lengthened.)\nThe difference in quality between the factory welds and the new welds is readily discernable.\nThe increased fuel supply permits a longer engine burn, which in turn increases the range of the missile.\nThe Burkhan 2-H uses a smaller warhead than the SCUD B; as such, the guidance and control section had been reconfigured to a smaller diameter, and an inter-stage section added to connect the warhead/guidance section with the main airframe.\u201d\n\ufeff\nThose who have been paying attention to this conflict have been well aware that the U.S. has had little material evidence to link Yemen\u2019s Houthis to Iranian arms suppliers.\nIn January of this year, a panel of U.N. experts stated:\n\u201cThe panel has not seen sufficient evidence to confirm any direct large-scale supply of arms from the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, although there are indicators that anti-tank guided weapons being supplied to the Houthi or Saleh forces are of Iranian manufacture.\u201d [emphasis added]\nEven if Iran were arming the Houthis, Haley\u2019s hypocritical anti-Iran rhetoric doesn\u2019t excuse the U.S. for continuing a foreign policy that essentially armed ISIS through U.S. weapons transfers, or for arming al-Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Syria, just to name two examples of Washington\u2019s schizophrenic approach to the region.\nWhy is the U.S. singling out Iran, especially when the Houthi rebels are sworn enemies of al-Qaeda?\nThe issues here go much deeper than nonsensical hypocrisy.\nAccording to Ritter, the entire debacle has shown that if Saudi Arabia cannot contain the Houthi\u2019s missile capabilities, it cannot possibly hope to take on Iran, which possesses a significantly more advanced military than the Houthis do on their own.\nRitter explains further:\n\u201cIf a relatively unsophisticated foe such as the Houthi, using Iranian-modified Soviet and North Korean missiles derived from 40-year-old technology, can evade an enemy force using the most modern combat aircraft backed up by the most sophisticated intelligence gathering systems available, and successfully launch ballistic missiles that threaten the political and economic infrastructure of the targeted state, what does that say about the prospects of any U.S.-led coalition taking on the far more advanced mobile missile threats that exist in North Korea and Iran today?\nThe fact of the matter is that no military anywhere has shown the ability to successfully interdict in any meaningful way a determined opponent armed with mobile ballistic missile capability.\nIf the Saudi experience in Yemen is to teach us anything, it is that any military plan designed to confront nations such as North Korea, Iran and Russia that are armed with sophisticated mobile ballistic missiles had better count on those capabilities remaining intact throughout any anticipated period of hostility.\nNo amount of chest-thumping and empty rhetoric by American political and/or military leaders can offset this harsh reality.\nThis is the critical lesson of Yemen, and the United States would do well to heed it before it tries to foment a crisis based upon trumped-up charges.\u201d [emphasis added]\n\n",

alternative media purge was boldly advanced in a coordinated effort to silence people who dissent from establishment views.\nIt\u2019s just one more step toward a monopoly on information by those who hate freedom.\nAt this rate, they\u2019ll soon have unquestioned access to the minds of more than 2 billion people.\nAnd this should terrify everyone who wants to be free to question the status quo and to seek a wide range of information.\nHundreds of alternative media site administrators logged onto Facebook to discover that their accounts had been removed.\nSoon after, many of these sites and their writers found that their Twitter accounts had also been suspended.\nPopular pages like The AntiMedia (2.1 million fans), The Free Thought Project (3.1 million fans), Press for Truth (350K fans), Police the Police (1.9 million fans), Cop Block (1.7 million fans), and Punk Rock Libertarians (125K fans) are just a few of the ones which were unpublished.\nWhy were these alternative media accounts

given doesn\u2019t really add up.\nFacebook told the LA Times that these pages had violated the company\u2019s spam policies.\n\u201cToday, we\u2019re removing 559 Pages and 251 accounts that have consistently broken our rules against spam and coordinated inauthentic behavior,\u201d the company said in a blog post.\n\u201cPeople will only share on Facebook if they feel safe and trust the connections they make here.\u201d (source)\nBut this isn\u2019t actually what their spam policy says.\nHere\u2019s the policy.\nWe work hard to limit the spread of commercial spam to prevent false advertising, fraud, and security breaches, all of which detract from people\u2019s ability to share and connect.\nWe do not allow people to use misleading or inaccurate information to collect likes, followers, or shares.\nDo Not: Artificially increase distribution for financial gain\nCreate or use fake accounts or compromise other people\u2019s accounts to\nImpersonate or pretend to be a

credentials or personally identifiable information\nUsing another person\u2019s login credentials or personally identifiable information\nPromise non-existent Facebook features (source)\nThe Washington Post originally said that these pages were purged for \u201cpushing political messages for profit\u201d as you can see by their URL:\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/10/11/facebook-purged-over-accounts-pages-pushing-political-messages-profit/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.fa1a364488b3\nBut of course, since they too push political messages for profit (waaah, Trump!)\nas do all the other corporate media outlets out there, they changed their headline to \u201cFacebook purged over 800 U.S. accounts and pages for pushing political spam.\u201d\nThe fact that many of these accounts were also suspended by Twitter shortly thereafter should tell you that this is a coordinated effort to silence large swaths of the population.\nOf course, the best coverage of this is from\u2026Russia.\nSputnik News contacted many of the alternative journalists who were purged to get their take on what happened.\nYou may recall that basically every blogger outside the establishment media was accused of being secretly Russian during the 2016 election by the Washington Post, so perhaps actual Russians have a vested interest in the truth coming out on this topic.\nMy friend John Vibes is an amazing person who contributes to The Free Thought Project.\nHe said:\nThis signifies a re-consolidation of the media.\nCable news media controlled the narrative for most of modern history, but the internet has lowered that barrier to entry and allowed the average person to become the media themselves.\nThis obviously took market share and influence away from the traditional media, and it has allowed for a more diverse public conversation.\nNow it seems the platforms that have monopolized the industry are favoring mainstream sources and silencing alternative voices.\nSo now, instead of allowing more people to have a voice, these platforms are creating an atmosphere where only powerful media organizations are welcome, just as we had on cable news.\nPeople think that we are just providing an activist spin on the news, but they don\u2019t see the families struggling to have their voice heard.\nFor example, when someone is shot by police, mainstream media sources often just republish the press release from the police department, without presenting the victim\u2019s side of the story.\nWe give the victims and their families a voice, which is essential to keep power in check.\nThis also goes for bigger issues like foreign policy as well; multiple full-scale invasions of Syria have been prevented because of information that the alternative media made viral.\n(source)\nNicholas Bernabe of The AntiMedia is another alternative journalist I consider a friend and support wholeheartedly.\nHe\u2019s worked tirelessly to be a voice of truth in a world of lies.\nHe told Sputnik:\nOur approach generally is to cover stories and angles that corporate media underreport or misreport and to amplify activist and anti-war voices and stories.\nAll of our content is professionally fact-checked and edited.\nI got into this line of work because I felt there was a need for media that challenged mainstream assumptions and biases in politics.\nI wanted to shed light on corruption and wrongdoing against oppressed peoples and cover the harsh truth about American foreign policy.\nOver the last 28 days, we reached 7,088,000 people on Facebook.\nThe timing of this purge is rather dubious in my view, coming shortly before the midterm elections.\nThis could be an attempt by Facebook itself to affect the outcome of the coming elections.\nThe Twitter suspension caught me by surprise.\nI can only speculate that these suspensions were a coordinated effort to stifle our message ahead of the coming elections.\n(source)\nRemember, this is coordinated, across multiple platforms.\nRemember when this happened to Alex Jones?\nBack in September, an assault was led by YouTube, Google, and Facebook against Alex Jones of Infowars fame.\nAll of his accounts were shut down in quick succession, followed by his credit card processing companies and his newsletter service providers.\nI wrote at the time, \u201cAlex Jones is just the beginning of this purge.\nIt\u2019s going to get much worse.\u201d\nMeanwhile, other dissenting voices were being silenced on social media with limited reach and \u201cshadow banning.\u201d\nInfowars is a massive profit machine.\nBut what happens when similar attacks are launched on smaller alternative media outlets?\nIt hits us right in the wallet.\nAnd if they\u2019re hit hard enough, they\u2019ll cease to be able to function.\nJones has a lot of money so this may not be the end of him, but for most website owners, this would be the absolute end of our ability to do business.\nAnd to be able to bring the information we bring, we do have to run our websites as businesses.\nIt\u2019s far more expensive than most people realize to run a site.\nI know that my own operating costs every month are more than $2000.\nA site as big as Jones\u2019s would be many times that amount.\nWhen all your avenues of monetization are cut off, it wouldn\u2019t be hard for a site \u2013 and the dissent and information they share \u2013 to cease to exist.\n(source)\nThis is not just about Facebook or Twitter.\nIt\u2019s about the ability to find dissenting information, period.\nGoogle is in on it too.\nA leaked document from Google supported the idea of censorship.\nAnother Google document has found its way into the public domain, this time through Breitbart.\nThe news publication reports that an 85-page briefing entitled \u201cThe Good Censor,\u201d advises tech companies to \u201cpolice tone instead of content\u201d and to not \u201ctake sides\u201d when censoring users\u2026 Google might continue to shift with the times \u2013 changing its stance on how much or how little it censors (due to public, governmental or commercial pressures).\nIf it does, acknowledgment of what this shift in position means for users and for Google is essential.\nShifting blindly or silently in one direction or another rightly incites users\u2019 fury\u2026 The Google \u201cinternal research\u201d even quotes outside experts like George Soros who express justification of censorship in non-U.S. markets, noting that Google should police \u201ctone instead of content\u201d and \u201ccensor everyone equally,\u201d as Breitbart put it.\n(source)\nThere are 2 trillion Google searches per day.\nPER.\nDAY.\nThat should give you an idea of the power of something like Google.\nCombine it with billions of Facebook and Twitter users and you can easily see the influence wielded here.\nThis is where free thought goes to die.\nRon Paul reminds us that truth is treason.\nRon Paul, former senator and the libertarian voice of reason, said when Jones was purged:\n\u201cYou get accused of treasonous activity and treasonous speech because in an empire of lies the truth is treason,\u201d Paul told the Russia-based news outlet.\n\u201cChallenging the status quo is what they can\u2019t stand and it unnerves them, so they have to silence people.\u201d \u201cSome of us tell the truth about our government, they call us treasonous and say we\u2019re speaking out of line and they\u2019d like to punish us, and I think that\u2019s part of what\u2019s happening with social media,\u201d Paul told RT, adding that he hopes anti-government or anti-war voices can eliminate their \u201cdependency\u201d on the current social media platforms.\n\u201cI\u2019m just hoping that technology can stay ahead of it all and that we can have real alternatives to the dependency on Twitter and other companies that have been working hand in glove with the government,\u201d Paul added.\n(source)\nHere\u2019s a video from last month with Dr. Paul\u2019s thoughts about the social media purge.\nIn it, he reminds us that Facebook is a private entity so they do have every right to remove the pages they wish.\nThe danger \u2013 and the area in which this treads on the First Amendment \u2013 is their direct ties to the government.\nThis affects everyone.\nIf you\u2019re reading this and you shrug because you, personally, don\u2019t have a Twitter or Facebook account, you\u2019re missing the bigger point.\nConsider the fact that the \u201cpopulation\u201d of Facebook is bigger than the populations of the US, China, and Brazil combined.\nThat\u2019s how many people will now only receive one side of the story on things like war, politics, guns, and current events.\nPeople will believe what they\u2019re told because there is no alternative information presented.\nThere are no questions asked.\nIt\u2019s literally the textbook definition of brainwashing.\nDefinition of brainwashing\n1: a forcible indoctrination to induce someone to give up basic political, social, or religious beliefs and attitudes and to accept contrasting regimented ideas 2: persuasion by propaganda or salesmanship (source)\n(Here\u2019s an article from Psychology Today that discusses how Facebook is, in fact, brainwashing people for profit.)\nSocial media is a massive source of information and influence today.\nIf the information is rigged by entities that support socialism, gun control, and the end of privacy, we\u2019re doomed.\n2.2 billion active users will be bombarded with these messages without any real option for the other side of the story.\nSo regardless of whether you, personally, participate, this will color popular sentiment to a massive degree.\nIt will grow the cognitive dissonance that assures people of things like \u201cthe government is your friend\u201d and that \u201cyou don\u2019t need to protect yourself, the police will take care of you.\u201d\nPeople who hate freedom will get unfettered access to the minds of 2 billion people.\nThat should scare the crap out of you.\nWhat can you do about the alternative media purge?\nIt\u2019s possible but unlikely that social pressure on Facebook and Twitter will push the outlets into restoring the accounts of these alternative media networks.\nBut even if they are restored, I suspect their reach will dwindle even further.\nHere are a few things you can do:\nSubscribe to the newsletters of websites you enjoy.\nDon\u2019t count on seeing their work on social media.\n(You can subscribe to my newsletter here, incidentally.)\nSupport them financially if you can.\nMany sites have Patreon accounts or donate buttons\nBookmark them and visit regularly \u2013 if they have ads, your visits help them to make the money they need to stay afloat.\nShare their articles on your own social media accounts.\nIf they can\u2019t get their work out there, we can help.\nJoin alternative social media outlets like Gab and MeWe.\nThe truth is getting harder and harder to find.\nYou\u2019re going to have to dig for it.\nWe\u2019re watching the biggest campaign against freedom of speech and thought that has ever occurred in our part of the world.\nThe alternative media purge is just the beginning.\nAnd we should all be very concerned.\nArticle posted with

Al Franken announced his resignationon the Senate floor Thursday morning, as Democratic calls for his resignation mount following the latest sexual misconduct accusations against him.\n\nAbout 30 Senate Democrats, starting with women, have urged the Minnesota Democrat to step down.\n\nFranken on Thursday denied most of the allegations, which started to surface last month.\nHere are the eight accusations he faces:\n\nLeeann Tweeden, a radio news anchor, says Franken groped and forcibly kissed her during a USO tour in 2006, before the former comedian was a senator.\nShe says Franken \"aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth\" when the pair rehearsed a skit that featured a kiss.\nA photo also surfaced showing Franken looking at a camera while pretending to grab Tweeden's breasts as she was sleeping while clothed.\nThe senator apologized for the photo but said he remembered the skit incident differently.\nLindsay Menz says Franken grabbed her buttocks when the pair posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010.\nFranken later said he did not remember taking the picture but \"felt badly\" that Menz felt disrespected.\nTwo other unidentified women told HuffPost that Franken grabbed their buttocks at separate events in 2007 and 2008.\nOne of the women says Franken suggested that he and she should go to the bathroom together.\nFranken said he did not remember the events and denied asking anyone to visit the bathroom with him.\nStephanie Kemplin, an Army veteran, says Franken put his hand on her breast during a USO tour in 2003.\nIn a statement following that accusation, Franken's office said he has not \"intentionally engage in\" the \"kind of conduct\" described.\nA woman described as a \"former elected official in New England\" told the Jezebel website that Franken tried to give her a \"wet, open-mouthed kiss\" during an event in 2006.\nThe senator has not appeared to respond specifically to the allegation.\nAn unnamed former Democratic congressional aide told Politico that the senator tried to forcibly kiss her after he taped a radio show in 2006.\nShe says she avoided the kiss, then heard Franken say \"it's my right as an entertainer.\"\nFranken called the allegation \"categorically not true.\"\nTina Dupuy writes in The Atlantic that Franken put his hand around her waist while the pair posed for a photo and squeezed \"at least twice\" during an event in 2009.\nThe senator has not specifically responded to that allegation.\n\n\n\n",

Keith Ellison because the lawmaker\u2019s ex-girlfriend refused to provide video of the incident - but the findings are still being turned over to law enforcement.\n\nThe Associated Press on Monday reported that it obtained a draft of a report written by Susan Ellingstad, a lawyer hired by Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party to investigate the claim against Ellison.\n\n\n\"The investigation report, which was released today without our knowledge by someone outside of our organization, was unable to substantiate the claim of physical abuse made by Ms. Monahan,\u201d DFL Chairman Ken Martin said in a statement.\n\nMartin said they planned to turn over the report to local law enforcement.\n\n\u201cFor the purpose of objectivity and getting all of the facts regarding these allegations, we have decided to forward the information in the investigation to local authorities in order to let them review the contents and determine whether further investigation is warranted,\u201d Martin said.\nThe Democratic congressman, who serves as deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has denied the allegations.\n\nIn a statement, Ellison thanked Ellingstad for conducting a \"thorough, independent, and fair review.\"\n\n\"I believe women who come forward must be heard, and to have their allegations fully investigated,\" Ellison said.\n\"This is why I have complied with this investigation fully, and will do so with any other inquiries.\n... At this time, I will be focusing on the issues of this important election.\"\n\nEllison\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan, alleged in August that Ellison dragged her off a bed by her feet while screaming obscenities at her in 2016.\nMonahan said she had video footage of the incident and levied the allegation just days ahead of a crowded Democratic primary for Minnesota attorney general that Ellison went on to win.\n\nThe state's Democratic party launched an investigation into the claim, retaining a local attorney with links to the state party to determine whether the alleged incident took place.\nDemocratic party chairman Ken Martin said last week he expected the investigation to conclude soon.\n\nA draft report obtained by the AP noted Monahan's shifting rationale for refusing to produce the video footage, including that it was lost, was on a USB drive in storage and would be too embarrassing and traumatic to release it.\n\nThe Ellison accusations have put Democrats in an uncomfortable position, as they speak out on sexual misconduct claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\nKavanaugh denies the accusations.\n\nMonahan slammed the Democratic Party for its response to her allegations when compared to its treatment of Christine Blasey Ford.\nFord has accused Kavanaugh of attempting to force himself onto her during a high school party nearly four decades ago.\nMany prominent Democrats have supported Ford\u2019s allegations.\n\n\u201cNo, they don't,\u201d Monahan tweeted in response to a question of whether the party believes women\u2019s stories.\n\u201cI've been smeared, threatened, isolated from my own party.\nI provided medical records from 2017, stating on two different Dr.\nVisits, I told them about the abuse and who did it.\nMy therapist released records stating I have been dealing and healing from the abuse.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cFour people, including my supervisor at the time, stated that I came to them after and shared the exact story I shared publicly, I shared multiple text between me and Keith, where I discuss the abuse with him and much more.\nAs I said before, I knew I wouldn't be believed.\u201d\nMany other Democrats and progressives \u2013 who largely stayed silent after the accusations against Ellison emerged \u2013 came out in support of Ford, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Tom Perez, chairman of the DNC, who urged to investigate the claims and Kavanaugh.\n\nMonahan went to reiterate that her story has nothing to do with politics.\n\u201cI have nothing to prove to anyone, I simply shared my story.\nPeople can believe it or not.\nI don\u2019t need anyone to affirm my humanity, I affirmed it,\u201d she wrote in another tweet.\n\n\u201cThe fact that both parties only care if it scores political points is hypocritical,\u201d she added.\n\u201cDo you think a person who has dealt with any form of abuse by politicians is thinking about politics?\nNo, we & are families are trying to heal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

attorney Lee Merritt said.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s unfortunate that law enforcement begin to immediately criminalize the victim\u2014in this case, someone who was clearly was the victim that has absolutely no bearing on the fact that he was shot in his home,\u201d Merritt added to Fox 4.\nPointing out the glaring nature of the smear campaign was the fact that there has been absolutely zero information released about the warrants conducted on officer Amber Guyger, the killer cop who lived just below Jean.\n\u201cI would love to see more information coming out about the warrants executed on the home of the shooter who lived just below him.\nI haven\u2019t seen any of those,\u201d said Merritt.\nMerritt accused the department of conducting a \u201ccommon assassination attempt on the victim that we often see in law enforcement involved shootings.\u201d Sadly, he appears to be correct in his accusations.\nIt is standard procedure for police to dig up dirt on their victims in attempts to smear and assassinate their character to make the killer cops look good in the public eye.\nEven sadder, however, is the fact that these smear campaigns work most of the time.\nAs the Free Thought Project reported on Wednesday, according to police \u2014 who continue to attempt to spin this story into some tragic mistake \u2014 Guyger accidentally went into the wrong apartment, mistook Jean for an intruder and killed him.\n\u201cGuyger entered the building and walked down the fourth-floor hallway to what she thought was her apartment,\u201d according to the arrest warrant made public Monday afternoon.\n\u201cShe inserted a unique door key, with an electronic chip, into the door keyhole.\nThe door, which was slightly ajar prior to Guyger\u2019s arrival, fully opened under the force of the key insertion.\u201d\n\u201cGuyger drew her firearm, gave verbal commands that were ignored by \u2026 Jean,\u201d according to the warrant.\n\u201cGuyger fired her handgun two times striking [Jean] in the torso.\nGuyger entered the apartment, immediately called 911, requesting police and EMS, and provided first aid to \u2026 Jean.\n\u201cDue to the interior darkness of the apartment, Guyger turned on the interior lights while on the phone with 911.\nUpon being asked where she was located by emergency dispatchers, Guyger returned to the front door to observe the address and discovered she was at the wrong apartment,\u201d according to the arrest warrant.\nAt no time, according to the warrant, does Guyger say what \u201cverbal commands\u201d she gave.\nWhat\u2019s more, any verbal commands she did give were entirely irrelevant as she was the intruder\u2014not Jean.\nAttempting to imply that Jean was somehow at fault for his own death for disobeying the commands of a homicidal cop who\u2019d just illegally broken into his home is as irresponsible as it is reprehensible.\nWhat\u2019s more, according to the attorneys for Jean, when Guyger was on the phone with police, she had to go outside to verify the address of the apartment\u2014implying that she knew she was in the wrong apartment from the start.\n\u201cFrom the fact that when you look at an affidavit and I\u2019m thinking that I\u2019m at my house and I call 911 because someone was just shot,\u201d Attorney Daryl Washington said.\n\u201cWell, the very first thing that I\u2019m going to do is I\u2019m not going to go outside and look at my address?\nI\u2019m going to give them my address right there on the phone.\nI\u2019m going to say I\u2019m on the phone.\nMy address is this.\nWhy did she have to go outside to verify the address?\nIt makes no sense whatsoever.\u201d\nEven more ominous than having to verify the address is the fact that according to witnesses, Guyger\u2019s story of inserting the key into Jean\u2019s door and it opening up was simply not true.\nAccording to witnesses, Guyger was banging on Jean\u2019s door, demanding he let her in.\n\u201cIndependent witnesses have already come forward to say that they heard this officer pounding on the door and demanding to be let in,\u201d Lee Merritt, one of the attorneys representing the Jean family, told ABC News.\n\u201cThe contradictions begin to build from there.\u201d\nThe doors in the complex are also equipped with an automatic closing mechanism.\nThis was demonstrated by the attorneys who opened the door and released it several times\u2014showing that it closed every single time\u2014blowing the claim that the door was somehow ajar completely out of the water.\nJean\u2019s family also pointed out that it would have been incredibly unlikely for Guyger to mistake Jean\u2019s apartment for her own as he had a distinct red door mat which would have been enough for the cop to know she was at the wrong place.\nThe hallway outside the apartment where Botham Jean was shot and killed by a Dallas Police officer.\npic.twitter.com/2xN9xqppRC \u2014 Allison Harris (@AllisonFox4News) September 8, 2018\nEven as cops come to Guyger\u2019s defense and attempt to shame, smear, and discredit her victim\u2014who was an upstanding member of society regardless of the plant they claim to have found\u2014they are failing miserably.\nDespite cops rallying behind the blue line to defend this killer cop, the rest of the country is not buying it.\nIn a damning tweet, writer Kashana Cauley summed up the nature of the smear campaign quite succinctly.\nIn response to cops claiming to find a tiny bit of weed, she pointed out that there was also a homicidal cop inside too.\nHis apartment also contained an off duty homicidal cop.\nhttps://t.co/Nq5wDpmukq \u2014 Kashana (@kashanacauley) September 13, 2018\nArticle posted with permission from The Free Thought Project\n\n",

        "target": "Madagascar Hospitals On High Alert: \u2018No One Is Safe\u2019 From The Black Plague\n\nTravelers are being warned to keep their distance from areas of Madagascar affected by the bubonic plague.\nAs the outbreak worsens, some doctors are even warning that \u201cno one is safe\u201d from the disease.\nThe outbreak of the black plague in Madagascar has so far killed 97 people, and doctors are warning that it will be continuing to spread and worsen, meaning no one is safe.\nHealth officials say the disease, which contributed to the deaths of more than 50 million people in Europe during the Middle Ages, has spread from rural areas to the more urban areas not usually affected.\nHundreds of cases are reported on the tropical island every year, but experts are warning the epidemic is \u201cmuch more dangerous\u201d than in previous years.\nOfficials have reported infections in 17 of the island nation\u2019s 22 regions since the outbreak started in August.\nAnd the number of cases is growing by the day, said Elhadj As Sy, the secretary general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) as the nation put all hospitals on high alert.\nThe hospitals have also begun implementing preventative measures with attempts to stall the spread of the bacterial infection.\nThe IFRC said it\u2019s introducing the same \u201csafe and dignified\u201d burial methods used in West Africa during the 2014 Ebola epidemic.\nThis helps cut the chain of transmission by preventing further infections through direct contact with infected corpses.\nLast week, less than 60 people had died and around 600 had been infected.\nNow, there are 911 confirmed cases in addition to the almost 100 deaths.\nWhile cases of bubonic plague occur in Madagascar nearly every year, the much more dangerous and deadly pneumonic plague has never been so prevalent.\nIt arrived earlier than expected this year, and has become much more contagious with it being transmitted from person to person through the air.\nPneumonic plague is the most life-threatening form of the infection caused by the manifestation of a Yersinia pestis bacterial infection.\nAlthough the black plague can be treated effectively with antibiotics, the incubation time of this bacteria is incredibly short.\nDeath often occurs within 12-24 hours of becoming infected.\nThe bubonic strain of the disease is spread through the bites of infected fleas, whereas the more contagious and deadly pneumonic type is spread through the coughing or sneezing of an infected person.\nElhadj As Sy said that overcoming the epidemic would require long-term help, not \u201cjust intervening at the peak and then forgetting about it\u201d.\nDr. Manitra Rakotoarivony, Madagascar\u2019s director of health promotion, said: \u201cNormally, people who catch the plague live in poor areas, but people in every place in society are catching the disease.\u201d\nJimmy Whitworth, professor of International Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told The Sun: \u201cIt has been a long time since we have seen the plague in an urban environment.\nAlthough health officials have said that internationally, the threat is still fairly low, they\u2019ve also said no one in Madagascar is safe, including travelers, spiking concerns over a possible global pandemic.\n\n",

        "target": "Accused Woman Abuser Keith Ellison Asks House Ethics to Investigate\n\nWell, unlike Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), who is running for attorney general in Minnesota without an active attorney's license, has not stood before a committee to deny or address accusations against him by several women who have accused him of verbal and physical abuse.\nAt least one woman even filed a police report about his abuse.\nNo, Ellison has called on the House of Representatives, not the FBI, as Senate Democrats have urged in the case of Judge Kavanaugh, to investigate the claims.\n\"I am taking this step now because I am innocent and eager to see this entire matter resolved,\u201d Ellison said in a statement.\n\u201cThese allegations have lingered in the public sphere, and remain unsubstantiated,\" he added.\n\"I welcome an investigation by the House to allow us to move on.\"\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\n* John Bolton Richard Grenell Dina Powell Heather Nauert Ivanka Trump\nEmail *\nComments This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nWell, that's not entirely accurate.\nWe do have a police report, unlike the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh.\nOf course, his supporters have hired an attorney to perform an investigation.\nThe Star Tribune reports:\nThe Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party has hired attorney Susan Ellingstad to conduct a separate investigation.\nEllingstad is a partner at the firm where attorney Charles Nauen, who represents the DFL, works.\nDFL Chairman Ken Martin said on Tuesday that the investigation was finished or close to finished and would be released soon.\nEllison is also deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee.\nAfter the domestic abuse allegation emerged in August, the DNC said it is looking into what happened.\n\u201cAll allegations of domestic abuse are disturbing and should be taken seriously.\nWe are working with the Minnesota state party to review these allegations,\u201d a DNC spokeswoman said in a statement Wednesday morning, declining to comment further.\nThe Democratic Party\u2019s choice of Ellingstad to conduct the investigation was met with derision from many who said she is not independent, including Donald Trump Jr., who mocked the investigation in a Tweet Wednesday.\nThe firm Ellingstad works for, Lockridge Grindal Nauen, has a political committee that has donated to both Republican and Democratic candidates, including Ellison, according to Federal Election Commission filings.\nThe contributions to Democrats outweigh the Republicans by a margin of about four to one.\nAs we previously reported:\nRep. Keith Ellison, who is currently running for attorney general of Minnesota, is being accused of domestic violence against his former partner Karen Monahan.\nAustin Monahan, Karen Monahan\u2019s son, aired the allegations in a Facebook post Saturday night.\nAccording to Austin Monahan, Ellison put his mother through \u201cpure hell.\u201d In the Facebook post, he claims to have seen a video of Ellison dragging Karen Monahan off the bed by her feet while screaming expletives at her.\nThe alleged incident is just one of several, Austin Monahan warned.\nState Rep. Debra Hilstrom (D-Brooklyn Center) was quick to voice her concern over the accusations, calling on Ellison to \u201canswer these allegations.\u201d DFL-endorsed candidate for attorney general of Minnesota Matt Pelikan also reacted to the story, calling the allegations \u201cextremely troubling.\u201d Karen Monahan has also hinted at the alleged abuse on Twitter, telling Ellison that her \u201ckids, job, health, finances, humanity was deeply impacted by the abuse you are well aware of.\u201d Karen Monahan claims she has videos, recordings, and messages to prove her story.\nEllison has admitted the relationship, but is denying the abuse.\nAnd the relationship was clearly real.\nKaren Monahan, an organizer with the Sierra Club, was in a relationship with Ellison for years.\nThe two are seen together in many of her social media posts, including hiking in together national parks and posing with the Obamas at the White House.\nRecords show she lived in his Minneapolis home before their relationship ended.\nEllison, who was previously married to a different woman, is divorced.\nIt's hard to know what really happened in a relationship.\nAnd the media has kept it quiet.\n\"Keith Ellison flatly denies allegation that he abused an ex girlfriend.\nThe story had been circulating in MN, and not held up under media scrutiny, so no stories ran.\nIt blew up last night after the ex\u2019s son posted the allegation on Facebook.\"\nDave Weigel.\nIt's not quite the first time for Keith X.\nThis is not the first time Ellison has faced misconduct allegations.\nIn 2006, a woman named Amy Alexandar claimed that Ellison ostracized her and smeared her name after having an extramarital affair with her in the 1990s and then again in the 2000s.\nEllison in 2005 filed a restraining order against her after what he described as phone and email harassment.\nShe subsequently tried to get a restraining order against him, which a judge denied, ordering her to stop repeating allegations of an affair or intimidation.\nEllison subsequently agreed to dismiss his restraining order against her if she no longer contacted him.\nI'm not sure that this is nothing more than damage control just before the elections.\nEllison won the primary days after the allegations were made public.\nOf course, accusations does not make one guilty for Ellison anymore than they do for Judge Kavanaugh.\nHowever, at least in the case of Ellison, at least one of the women were not scared about their reputation and had any political motive to call the police and file a report.\nWhen it comes to Ellison though, we know he is an effeminate pansy who simply does not want to answer to the American people and even seeks security to hide from a female report with a mic and a camera.\nJudge Kavanaugh has faced it all and fought back against it.\n\n",

Bush, and Obama regimes created between the two superpowers.\nYes, Russia is a superpower.\nRussian weapons are so superior to the junk produced by the waste-filled US military/security complex that lives high off the hog on the insouciant American taxpayer that it is questionable if the US is even a second class military power.\nIf the insane neoconservatives, such as Max Boot, William Kristol, and the rest of the neocon scum get their way, the US, the UK, and Europe will be a radioactive ruin for thousands of years.\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (CA), Minority Leader of the US House of Representatives, declared that out of fear of some undefined retribution from Putin, a dossier on Trump perhaps, the President of the United States sold out the American people to Russia because he wants to make peace: \u201cIt begs the question, what does Vladimir Putin, what do the Russians have on Donald Trump\u2014personally, politically and financially that he should behave in such a manner?\u201d The \u201csuch a manner\u201d Pelosi is speaking about is making peace instead of war.\nThe Tyranny of Good In... Paul Craig Roberts, La... Best Price: $5.64 Buy New $5.00 (as of 10:35 EDT - Details)\nTo be clear, the Democratic Minority Leader of the US House of Representatives has accused Donald Trump of high treason against the United States.\nThere is no outcry against this blatantly false accusation, totally devoid of evidence.\nThe presstitute media instead of protesting this attempt at a coup against the President of the United States, trumpet the accusation as self-evident truth.\nTrump is a traitor because he wants peace with Russia.\nHere is Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer (NY) repeating Pelosi\u2019s false accusation: \u201cMillions of Americans will continue to wonder if the only possible explanation for this dangerous behavior is the possibility that President Putin holds damaging information over President Trump.\u201d If you don\u2019t believe that this is orchestrated between Pelosi and Schumer, you are stupid beyond belief.\nHere is disgraced Obama CIA director John Brennan, a leader of the fake Russiagate campaign against President Trump in order to prevent Trump from making peace with Russia and, thus, by making the world safer, threatening the massive, unjustified budget of the military/security complex: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s press conference performance in Helsinki rises to and exceeds the threshold of high crimes and misdemeanors.\nIt was nothing short of treasonous.\nNot only were Trump\u2019s comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin.\nRepublican Patriots: Where are you??\n?\u201d\nHere are many more.\nAnd here is more from the CIA bought-and-paid-for BBC.\nNOTICE THAT NOT ONE WESTERN MEDIA SOURCE IS CELEBRATING AND THANKING TRUMP AND PUTIN FOR EASING THE ARTIFICAILLY CREATED TENSIONS THAT WERE LEADING TO NUCLEAR WAR.\nHOW CAN THIS BE?\nHOW CAN IT BE THAT THE WESTERN MEDIA IS SO OPPOSED TO PEACE?\nWHAT IS THE EXPLANATION?\nThe Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians, and the North Koreans, as well as the rest of the world, desperately need to notice the extremely hostile reaction to peace on the part of the US Democratic Party, many members of the Republican Party, including the despicable US Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, and the Western Presstitute Media, a collection of people on the CIA payroll according to the German newspaper editor, Udo Ulfkotte, and the CIA itself.\nNancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and the rest of the corrupt filth that rules over us are all in the pay of the military/security complex.\nJust go and investigate the donations to their re-election campaigns.\nThe 1,000 billion dollar budget of the military/security complex, amplified by the CIA\u2019s front corporations and narcotics business, provides enormous sums with which to purchase the senators and representatives that the insouciant American voters think that they elect.\nDo you know how large 1,000 billion is?\nYou would have to live for thousands of years and do nothing for 24/7 except count to reach that figure.\nIt is a sum that nurtures the recipients, and the recipients regard it as worth protecting.\nTherefore, the American public gets not representation, but lies that justify war and conflict.\nThe military/security complex, about which President Eisenhower warned the American people to no effect, is in desperate need of an enemy.\nIn obedience to the military/security complex, the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama regimes have made Russia that enemy.\nIf Trump and Putin do not understand this, they will easily be made irrelevant.\nThey both can be assassinated, and that is what the statements from Pelosi, Schumer, McCain, Lindsey Graham, et.\nal., repeated endlessly in the propaganda ministry that is the Western press, encourages.\nTrump can be assassinated or overthrown in a political coup for selling out America to Russia, as members of both political parties claim and as the media trumpets endlessly.\nPutin can be easily assassinated by the CIA operatives that the Russian government stupidly permits to operate throughout Russia in NGOs and Western/US owned media and among the Atlanticist Integrationists, Washington\u2019s Firth Column inside Russia serving Washington\u2019s purposes.\nThese Russian traitors serve in Putin\u2019s own government!\nThe Neoconservative Th... Dr. Paul Craig Roberts Best Price: $11.96 Buy New $19.34 (as of 02:05 EDT - Details)\nAmericans are so unaware that they have no idea of the risk that President Trump is taking by challenging the US military security complex.\nFor example, during the last half of the 1970s I was a member of the US Senate staff.\nI was working together with a staffer of the US Republican Senator from California, S. I. Hayakawa, to advance understanding of a supply-side economic policy cure to the stagflation that threatened the US budget\u2019s ability to meet its obligations.\nRepublican Senators Hatch, Roth, and Hayakawa were trying to introduce a supply-side economic policy as a cure for the stagflation that was threatening the US economy with failure.\nThe Democrats, who later in the Senate led the way to a supply-side policy, were, at this time, opposed (see Paul Craig Roberts, The Supply-Side Revolution, Harvard University Press, 1984).\nThe Democrats claimed that the policy would worsen the budget deficit, the only time in those days Democrats cared about the budget deficit.\nThe Democrats said that they would support the tax rate reductions if the Republicans would support offsetting cuts in the budget to support a balanced budget.\nThis was a ploy to put Republicans on the spot for taking away some groups\u2019 handouts in order \u201cto cut tax rates for the rich.\u201d\nThe supply-side policy did not require budget cuts, but in order to demonstrate the Democrats lack of sincerety, Hayakawa\u2019s aid and I had our senators introduce a series of budget cuts together with tax cuts that, on a static revenue basis (not counting tax revenue feedbacks from the incentives of the lower tax rates) kept the budget even, and the Democrats voted against them every time.\nWhen the combination of tax cuts with defense budget cuts came up for a vote, the legendary senator Strom Thurmond, a 48-year member of the US Senate from South Carolina, tapped me on the shoulder.\nHe said: \u201cson, never set your senator up against the military/security complex.\nHe will not be re-elected, and you will be out of a job.\u201d I replied that we were just establishing for the record that under no conditions would the Democrats, who wanted more government, vote for a tax rate reduction even if there was a case that it would cure stagflation.\nHe replied: \u201cson, the military/security complex doesn\u2019t care.\u201d\nMy emergence from The Matrix began with Thurmond\u2019s pat on my shoulder.\nIt grew with my time at the Wall Street Journal when I learned that some truthful things simply could not be said.\nIn the Treasury I experienced how those outside interests opposed to a president\u2019s policy marshall their forces and the media that they own to block it.\nLater as a member of a secret presidential committee, I saw how the CIA attempted to prevent President Reagan from ending the Cold War.\nToday, right now, at this moment, we are faced with a massive effort of the military/security complex, the neoconservatives, the Democratic Party, and the presstitute media to discredit the elected President of the United States and to overthrow him in order that the utterly corrupt elite that rule American can continue to hold on to power and to protect the massive budget of the military/security complex that, along with the Israel Lobby, funds the elections of those who rule us.\nTrump, like Reagan, was an exception, and it is the exceptions that accumulate the ire of the corrupt leftwing, bought off with money, and the ire of the media, concentrated into small tight ownership groups indebted to those who permitted the illegal concentration of a once independent and diverse American media that once served, on occasion, as a watchdog over government.\nThe rightwing, wrapped in the flag, dismisses all truth as \u201canti-American.\u201d\nIf Putin, Lavrov, the Russian government, the traitorous Russian Fifth Column\u2014the Atlanticist Integrationists\u2014the Chinese, the Iranians, the North Koreans think that any peace or consideration can come out of America, they are insane.\nTheir delusions are setting themselves up for destruction.\nThere is no institution in America, government or private, that can be trusted.\nAny government or person who trusts America or any Western country is stupid beyond belief.\nThe entire Russiagate hoax is an orchestration by the military/security complex, led by John Brennen, Comey, and Rosenstein.\nThe purpose is to discredit President trump for two reasons.\nOne is to prevent any normalization of relations with Russia.\nThe other is to remove Trump\u2019s agenda as an alternative to the agenda of the Democratic Party.\nHow America Was Lost: ... Dr. Paul Craig Roberts Best Price: $8.00 Buy New $8.51 (as of 02:00 EDT - Details)\nPresident Trump is almost powerless.\nPutin, the Chinese, the Iranians, and the North Koreans should recognize this before it is too late for them.\nPresident Trump cannot fire and arrest for high treason Mueller and Rosenstein.\nAnd Trump cannot indict Hillary for her numerous unquestionable crimes in plain view of everyone, or Comey or Brennan, who declares Trump \u201cto be wholly in the pocket of Putin,\u201d for trying to overthrow the elected president of the United States.\nTrump cannot have the Secret Service question the likes of Pelosi and Schumer and McCain and Lindsey Graham for false accusations that encourage assassination of the President of the United States.\nTrump cannot even trust the Secret Service, which accumulated evidence suggests was complicit in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy.\nIf Putin and Lavrov, so anxious to be friends of Washington, let their guards down, they are history.\nAs I said above, Russiagate is an orchestratration to prevent peace between the US and Russia.\nLeading military/security complex experts, including the person who provided the CIA\u2019s daily briefing of the President of the United States for many years, and the person who devised the spy program for the National Security Agency, have proven conclusively that Russiagate is a hoax designed for the purpose of preventing President Trump from normalizing relations between the US and Russia, which has the power to destroy the entirety of the Western World at will.\nHere is the report from the retired security professionals who, unlike those still in office, cannot be fired and deprived of a careet for telling the truth.\nHere is what the clued-in Russian Defense Minister Shoigu has to say about the aggressive actions of the West against the Russian homeland.\nIf Putin doesn\u2019t listen to him, Russia is in the trash can of history.\nKeep in mind that no media informs you better than my website.\nIf my website goes down, you will be left in darkness.\nNo valid information comes from the US government or the Western presstitutes.\nIf you sit in front of the TV screen watching the Western media, you are brainwashed beyond all hope.\nNot even I can rescue you.\nNor God himself.\nAmericans, and indeed the Russians themselves, are incapable of realizing it, but there is a chance that Trump will be overthrown and a Western assault will be launched against the handful of countries that insist on sovereignty.\nI doubt that few of the Americans who elected Trump will be taken in by the anti-Trump propagana, but they are not organized and have no armed power.\nThe police, militarized by George W. Bush and Obama, will be set against them.\nThe rebellions will be local and suppressed by every violation of the US Constitution by the private powers that rule Washington, as always has been the case with rebellions in America.\nIn the West, which the Russians are so anxious to join, all freedoms are dead\u2014freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of inquiry, freedom of privacy, freedom from arbitrary search, freedom from arbitrary arrest, along with the Constitutional protections of due process and habeas corpus.\nToday there are no countries less free than the United States of America.\nWhy do the Russian Atlanticist Integrationists want to join an unfree Western world?\nAre they that brainwashed by Western Propaganda?\nIf Putin listens to these deluded fools, Putin will destroy Russia.\nThere is something wrong with Russian perception of Washington.\nApparently the Russian elite, with the exception of Shoigu and a few others are incapable of comprehending the neoconservative drive for US world hegemony and the neoconservative determination to destroy Russia as a constraint on US unilateralism.\nThe Russian government somehow, despite all evidence to the contrary, believes that Washington\u2019s hegemony is negotiable.\nThe Best of Paul Craig Roberts\n\n",

Van Zandt 6/15/2018)\nStraight reporting?\nYou must be kidding me?\nDid David Van Zandt not watch Jim Acosta lie to Anderson Cooper about this episode and Cooper just sat there and let him lie to the American people, editing the video to not even show the point of contact in question?\nWhy yes, yes, he did!\nNot only that but it appears the MBFC doesn't know the documented history of CNN's complete fabrication of \"news,\" telling stories that never happened.\nMBFC isn't qualified to comment on the subject.\nIt isn't just MBFC though.\nNewcomer NewsGuard also covers for CNN.\nThis is supposed to be an outlet, at least what I was told in email and phone communication, that is simply to determine transparency of websites.\nInstead, they not only do that, but they go on to do far more than that.\nIn rating CNN, NewsGuard posts this nonsense.\nI'm sure NewsGuard, Yemile Bucay, Anna-Sophie Harling and Amy Westfeldt need to update this in the light of the obvious lies and editing of the Acosta video and decades of documented, outright lies and propaganda by the Clown News Network, but you can't expect real transparency from an outlet like Newsguard whose writers aren't transparent about their own political bias, can you?\nNope, you can't, and you can't expect it when some of those writers write for other publications that don't measure up to NewsGuard's standards either.\nThe reason this little incident shouldn't be let go of so soon is that it is one of the clearest demonstrations of the media's bias, which we all have, lies and propaganda.\nIt should be used over and over in article after article to remind people about the total dishonesty and complete disregard for reporting the facts by outlets such as CNN and to not blindly trust self-proclaimed fact-checkers who will not tell you the truth either.\nCNN has lost its mind to the point that they are suing over Acosta losing his press pass.\nHe was their inside boy, after all.\nBut the real irony here is that the media labeled Paul Joseph Watson and Infowars as \"conspiracy theorists\" and yet, PJW has exposed their blatant conspiracy to smear President Trump, Sarah Sanders and the White House aide.\nAnd Jim Acosta believes he and CNN deal with facts and Infowars doesn't.\nYeah, right!\nI'm sorry Jim, I can't hear you over the booming voice of your hypocrisy!\nArticle posted with permission from The Washington Standard\n\n",

story continues below\nShould Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?\nShould Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?\nShould Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?\n* Yes, he should have gotten it back.\nNo, you can't act like a child and keep your pass.\nMaybe?\nI'm not sure if he should have.\nEmail *\nEmail This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nHowever, the cable news channel is showing more and more that it is not fair and balanced and is far from what conservatives think it is as it blasted the White House about not giving little Jimmy his press pass back.\nIn a statement by Fox News President Jay Wallace, he wrote:\n\u201cFox News supports CNN in its legal effort to regain its White House reporter\u2019s press credential.\nWe intend to file an amicus brief with the U.S. District Court.\nSecret Service passes for working White House journalists should never be weaponized.\nWhile we don\u2019t condone the growing antagonistic tone by both the president and the press at recent media avails, we do support a free press, access and open exchanges for the American people.\"\nSo, file it!\nOn the basis of what, Mr. Wallace?\nThe free press still exists, and you know what?\nJim Acosta and CNN continue to lie, just like they have for decades, and here's the proof.\nLook how they doctored the video to not show what clearly took place and then lied about it, and I suppose Fox falls right in line with that behavior.\nSo, Fox joins with the least trusted name in news, the Clown News Network, to go after the White House on something that is the White House's prerogative and claim it's about free press.\nIt's not.\nFox reported:\nThe White House Correspondents\u2019 Association \u2013 of which Fox News is a member \u2013 issued a statement in support of CNN\u2019s decision to take legal action.\n\u201cWe continue to urge the administration to reverse course and fully reinstate CNN\u2019s correspondent,\u201d WHCA President Olivier Knox said.\n\u201cThe President of the United States should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him.\u201d However, several prominent media members \u2013 such as Pulitzer Prize-winning Watergate journalist Bob Woodward \u2013 have criticized CNN over the lawsuit.\nAs they should.\nIt's frivolous, but because they are immature children over at CNN, it's not surprising, and frankly, it's no surprise coming from Fox either.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders called the CNN lawsuit \"grandstanding.\"\nI wonder what she will call the amicus brief from Fox.\n\"This is just more grandstanding from CNN, and we will vigorously defend against this lawsuit,\u201d Sanders said.\n\u201cCNN, who has nearly 50 additional hard pass holders, and Mr. Acosta is no more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the First Amendment.\nAfter Mr. Acosta asked the President two questions \u2014 each of which the President answered \u2014 he physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions.\nThis was not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters.\u201d\nOf course, CNN was thrilled as Fox more than likely helped them grow a little in ratings by issuing support.\nThe propaganda outlet tweeted out Fox's statement.\nFox News will file an amicus brief in support of @Acosta and CNN.\nThank you @FoxNews!\nStatement from Jay Wallace below: pic.twitter.com/1EyRkho0TK \u2014 CNN Communications (@CNNPR) November 14, 2018\nHere's the thing, if it is a right to have a press pass to the White House, where is mine?\nand yours?\nHow about Infowars?\nSee?\nIt isn't a right and Fox News just pulled the mask off, people.\nDo you see who they really are now?\nIf not, I can't help you.\n\n",

(AP) - Federal prosecutors say the FBI has arrested five former residents of a ramshackle compound in New Mexico on firearms and conspiracy charges as local prosecutors dropped charges in the death of a 3-year-old boy at the property.\nTaos County District Attorney Donald Gallegos said Friday his office will now seek grand jury indictments involving the death.\nGallegos said seeking indictments will allow more time to gather evidence.\nAll five people will remain in custody pending a Tuesday hearing in federal court.\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office in Albuquerque said compound resident Jany Leveille has been charged with being an alien unlawfully in possession of firearms and ammunition.\nShe is a Haitian national.\nThe other four members are charged with conspiring with Leveille.\nAnd the death of the three-year-old?\nNothing!\nAnd what of the training of little jihadis?\nNothing!\n\u201cThe defendants, Jany Leveille, 35, a Haitian national illegally present in the United States, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, 40, Hujrah Wahhaj, 37, Subhanah Wahhaj, 35, and Lucas Morton, 40, are charged in a criminal complaint that was filed earlier today in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico,\u201d the bureau said in a statement.\n\u201cThe criminal complaint charges Jany Leveille with being an alien unlawfully in possession of firearms and ammunition in the District of New Mexico from Nov. 2017 through Aug. 2018,\u201d the bureau said.\n\u201cThe criminal complaint charges the other four defendants with aiding and abetting Leveille in committing the offense, and with conspiring with Leveille to commit the offense.\u201d\nYet, in the midst of all of this, don't forget that the FBI ignore the intelligence that was provided to them, just like they have in many cases, which, if they had acted, they may have saved the little boy's life.\nIn the meantime, the New Mexico district attorney who failed to file for a preliminary hearing within 10 days and didn\u2019t show up for court is vowing to pursue prosecution of these jihadis.\n\u201cThe actions yesterday by the district judges do not affect our continuing efforts to prosecute the individuals as charged originally,\u201d Eighth Judicial District Attorney Donald Gallegos said in a statement on Thursday.\n\u201cWhile we disagree with the judges, they did their jobs.\nWe will continue to do ours.\n\u201cGoing forward, our options are to refile the charges or take the cases to the grand jury.\nWe are assessing and will decide which avenue to pursue.\nWhat is important to know is that we will continue to pursue prosecution of the cases.\u201d\nStatementThe actions yesterday by the district judges do not affect our continuing efforts to prosecute the...

no, these women didn't wait decades or even till there was a politically opportune time to voice their accusations.\nOne even had reported him to the police.\nInvestigative journalist Laura Loomer was informed by police in Minnesota that he wanted police protection from her when he found out she was attending the education forum that was held Saturday.\nThis is a man who follows a demonic religion, Islam, and supports cop killers.\nHe does all of this while he stands accused of abusing women and running to be attorney general in Minnesota, even though he possesses no attorney's license that is valid.\nHere's Loomer's tweet from Sunday with video of her speaking to a policeman about it.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\nWho

open to union members and guests.\nPrior to the event, Ellison's campaign called police to ensure that he was \"protected\" from a woman armed with a mic and camera phone .\nLoomer peppered him with questions about the alleged abuse at a State Attorney General debate Friday night.\nShe stood alongside other female survivors of abuse.\nEllison not only claimed the women were lying but then fled the scene.\nAt least he said something there, which is more than I can say for his response earlier in September when Loomer confronted him at another event with questions.\nFailing to answer, Ellison tried to move from person to person, allowing his minions to try and provide cover for him, similar to that of Maxine Waters, but there was no \"member's only\" elevator to flee into.\nFinally, Ellison fled the scene, hounding by Loomer and others questioning him about the abuse.\nThe irony is of Ellison's campaign calling on the police to protect him from a woman, armed with a mic and camera phone, who is simply asking him to respond to the accusations and police report, as well as how he plans on being attorney general without a license, when he has shown his support for those that murder police officers in cold blood.\nScott Johnson reports on Ellison's sordid history supporting such criminals.\nEllison was an active supporter and local leader of the Nation of Islam in Minneapolis before his election to Congress.\n(I set forth this history in some detail in the October 9, 2006 issue of The Weekly Standard.)\nEllison has baldly dissembled about this history since 2006.\nIn his 2014 memoir My Country, \u2019Tis of Thee ,for example, Ellison simply omitted it and presented himself as a critic of Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam.\nThis past June, Ellison told Jake Tapper on CNN, \u201cI worked on the Million Man March and I was proud to do so.\nThat\u2019s it.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t it.\nEllison first sought office as a Democrat in 1998 as Keith Ellison-Muhammad, a self-avowed member of the Nation of Islam.\n(Ellison-Muhammad is just one of three Nation of Islam names Ellison has used over the years.)\nFortunately for him, Ellison\u2019s 5th District constituents haven\u2019t much cared about his history and the Minneapolis Star Tribune has almost entirely let it rest exactly where Ellison wants it.\nBut seeking the top law enforcement job in Minnesota and running for statewide office should be a more daunting challenge because Ellison is an extraordinarily poor fit for the job.\nAmong the troubling threads that run through Ellison\u2019s career: support for cop killers.\nIn September 1992 Minneapolis police officer Jerry Haaf was murdered execution-style, shot in the back as he took a coffee break at a restaurant in south Minneapolis.\nPolice later determined that Haaf\u2019s murder was a gang hit performed by four members of the city\u2019s Vice Lords gang.The leader of the Vice Lords was Sharif Willis, a convicted murderer who had been released from prison and who sought respectability as a responsible gang leader from gullible municipal authorities while operating a gang front called United for Peace.\nThe four Vice Lords members who murdered Haaf met and planned the murder at Willis\u2019s house.\nDespite the fact that two witnesses implicated Willis in the planning he was never charged because law enforcement authorities said they lacked sufficient evidence to convict him.\nAt the time, Ellison was a Minneapolis attorney in private practice.\nAnd within a month of Haaf\u2019s murder, Ellison appeared with Willis supporting the United for Peace gang front.\nIn October 1992, Ellison helped organize a demonstration against Minneapolis police that included United for Peace.\n\u201cThe main point of our rally is to support United for Peace [in its fight against] the campaign of slander the police federation has been waging,\u201d said Ellison.\nWillis was the last speaker at the demonstration.\nAccording to a contemporaneous report in the St. Paul Pioneer Press, Willis told the crowd that Minneapolis police were experiencing the same fear from young black men that blacks had felt from police for many years.\n\u201cIf the police have some fear, I understand that fear,\u201d Willis said.\n\u201cWe seem to have an overabundance of bad police.\n.\n.\n.\n[W]e\u2019re going to get rid of them,\u201d Willis said.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got to go.\u201d The Pioneer Press account concludes with Ellison\u2019s contribution to the demonstration: \u201cEllison told the crowd that the police union is systematically frightening whites in order to get more police officers hired.\nThat way, Ellison said, the union can increase its power base.\u201d Ellison publicly supported the Haaf murder defendants.\nIn February 1993, he spoke at a demonstration for one of them during his trial.\nEllison led the crowd assembled at the courthouse in a chant that was ominous in the context of Haaf\u2019s cold-blooded murder: \u201cWe don\u2019t get no justice, you don\u2019t get no peace.\u201d Ellison\u2019s working relationship with Sharif Willis finally came to an end in February 1995, when Willis was convicted in federal court on several counts of drug and gun-related crimes and sent back to prison for 20 years.\nThe Haaf case wasn\u2019t an aberration for Ellison.\nIn February 2000, he spoke at a fundraiser sponsored by the Minnesota chapter of the old National Lawyers Guild, on whose steering committee he had served\u2014the chapter was raising funds for former Symbionese Liberation Army member Kathleen Soliah, who had been a fugitive from justice for 25 years, on charges related to the attempted pipe bombing of Los Angeles police officers in 1975.\n(The National Lawyers Guild is an old Communist front group that somehow survived the fall of the Soviet Union.\nRegimes come and go; dupes are forever.)\nIn his National Lawyers Guild speech Ellison spoke favorably of cop killers Mumia Abu-Jamal and \u201cAssata Shakur\u201d (Joanne Chesimard), who was wanted for the murder of New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster in 1973.\nChesimard was convicted of that murder but escaped from prison in 1979 and has been on the lam in Cuba since 1984.\nBryan Burrough\u2019s Days of Rage has a riveting account of Chesimard\u2019s terrorist career.\nIn 2013, the FBI made Chesimard the first woman named to its Most Wanted Terrorists List.\nThe FBI has offered a reward of up to $1,000,000 for her capture.\nYet Ellison prayed for Chesimard in his National Lawyers Guild speech: \u201cI am praying that Castro does not get to the point where he has to really barter with these guys over here because they\u2019re going to get Assata Shakur, they\u2019re going to get a whole lot of other people,\u201d he told the crowd.\n\u201cI hope the Cuba[n] people can stick to it, because the freedom of some good decent people depends on it.\u201d Ellison\u2019s support for Soliah/Olson in the speech is equally notable.\nHe denounced law enforcement authorities for prosecuting the attempted murder of police officers.\nReferring to the days Soliah/Olson had spent in the SLA under the leadership of Donald DeFreeze (\u201cField Marshal Cinque\u201d), Ellison hailed Soliah/Olson as a \u201cblack gang member\u201d and portrayed her as a victim of government persecution.\nHe described her as one of those who had been \u201cfighting for freedom in the \u201860s and\u201970s\u201d and called for her release.\nEllison to the contrary notwithstanding, Soliah/Olson pleaded guilty to the crimes charged in Los Angeles and to an additional murder charge in Sacramento.\nAccording to Ellison, Soliah/Olson was a social justice warrior fighting the good fight.\nThe case had nothing to do with the attempted murder of police officers; that was but a pretext.\nSeems he is more than willing to use the police to shield him from the press who will confront him publicly while taking the side of their murderers for political gain.\nShame on you, Hakim Muhammad!\nArticle posted with permission

        "target": "More Independent Media To Be Shut Down\n\nThe very word \u201csecrecy\u201d is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings.\nWe decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it.\nEven today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions.\nEven today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it.\nAnd there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment.\n\u2013 JFK\nIf you haven\u2019t already heard, Facebook has completely shut down hundreds, if not thousands of Independent media pages over the last year.\nSome of the biggest pages include The Free Thought Project and The Anti-media, with millions of followers each, and years of sourced journalism.\nThese pages, among others, became targets a long time ago.\nWorking directly in the field and behind the scenes, I can tell you that all of us have been aware of the censorship initiative for a long time because it started approximately three years ago now.\nThe complete deletion of multiple pages kicked off by popular media figure Alex Jones, was followed by a massive campaign of \u201cfake news\u201d awareness.\nOne thing we need to remember here is, this isn\u2019t about democrats vs republicans, it\u2019s about the elite preserving their control, and at the moment, they are using the DNC as the mouthpiece for that.\nThus, anything that slandered Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign, for example, was labelled as fake news, even if evidence and credible sources were used.\nThis is because she is part of that elite.\nThis is cyber false flagging at its finest, where authority figures at Facebook and within government agencies decide for the people what is real, and what is not, These tactics are complemented by a large mainstream media campaign that created awareness about fake news.\nMonkey see, monkey do.\nWith Liberty and Justi... Glenn Greenwald Best Price: $2.66 Buy New $11.34 (as of 02:05 EST - Details)\nMany believed what media and social media did during that election, and still now, and take on the opinion that people cannot just say what they want on the internet.\nThis has some validity, but ultimately, the fact that Facebook pages with credibility were deleted makes it quite clear what\u2019s going on here.\nThese pages presented declassified documents, information about corporations and mainstream media, real whistleblower testimony and more.\nYet still, they were deleted.\nThe population should be able to examine a source of information and determine for themselves if it\u2019s credible, not have an authority figure do it for them.\nWe don\u2019t need fact checkers, we ourselves should be those fact checkers!\nWe have a responsibility to our planet to be those fact checkers, and not let authority figures with a tremendous amount of power, wealth, and conflicts of interests do it for us.\n\u201cThe problem of fake news isn\u2019t solved by hoping for a referee, but rather because we as citizens, we as users of these services, help each other.\nWe talk and we share and we point out what is fake.\nWe point out what is true.\nThe answer to bad speech is not censorship, the answer to bad speech is more speech.\nWe have to exercise and spread the idea that critical thinking matters, now more than ever, given the fact that lies seem to be getting more popular.\u201d \u2013Edward Snowden (source)\nFacebook A Revolving Door\nFacebook has become a revolving door like Monsanto, with high-ranking DARPA employees, like Regina Duggan, who has since left Facebook, and people from similar backgrounds now spearheading their mission.\nWhat is Facebook\u2019s mission?\nWell at the moment it seems to be censoring of information.\nTheir key strategy is to label everything as fake news to build an excuse to delete Facebook pages that are dissenting voices.\nYou see, independent media, like CE, became extremely popular, receiving many millions in website every single month, that traffic came from Facebook.\nIndependent media outlets were greatly surpassing mainstream media in their power and voice.\nThis is something people on the outside can\u2019t really see as all of this happens, but I am on the inside, so I see exactly what\u2019s taking place.\nEyes were shifting away from the small group of people who have controlled media since media\u2019s inception.\nIndependent media brought to light a number of facts that threaten the agenda of the global elite, like intelligence agency/government connections to mainstream media for example, and their plans in the middle east to basically invade, take-over, and establish a government that suits the Deep State\u2019s best interests.\nThere are several examples from all fields that surround human life, from healthcare to politics, and it all seems to be controlled by one massive conglomerate at the top.\nWe\u2019ve been writing about this for nearly a decade now.\nThe Deep State Has Power Due To Our Unconsciousness\nThey (global elite) continue to do what they are able to do because of human consciousness.\nThe more people who consider this a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d and turn their heads away, the easier it is for them to continue and have power.\nI don\u2019t understand how so much information can come to light, yet when it\u2019s deemed a \u201cconspiracy\u201d theory\u201d within mainstream media, everybody simply follows the rhetoric, without doing any investigation or research for themselves.\nIf you don\u2019t look into it, don\u2019t share an opinion on it.\n\u201cCondemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance.\u201d \u2013 Einstein.\nAll of these media sources were operating normally until Donald Trump became president, and until Hillary Clinton, Obama, Bush, etc were outed as global elite puppets.\nHeck, the Clinton\u2019s and John Podesta have even referenced Wikileaks before that became \u2018fake.\u2019 Despite operating with credibility for more than a decade before the accusations.\nWhat does the media operating normally mean?\nStill manipulating the public, but at least they were reporting on both sides as a whole.\nNow, it\u2019s quite different.\nDonald Trump is extremely vilified not because he allegedly is/was racist/sexist, but because he threatens neoliberalism and neoconservatism, the American empire, one that continues to try and push an Orwellian state type of existence, which seems to be ramping up every single year.\nTrump was not supposed to win, and no this isn\u2019t about democrats vs republicans or that Trump is a saviour.\nThe Deep State responded like they always do every time something \u2018goes wrong,\u2019 they blamed Russia, as well as media outlets like Collective Evolution and others.\nSome of which have now been deleted as mentioned above.\nTrump is Not The Solution, We Are\nThings are getting pretty ridiculous, but they\u2019re too late.\nEven if they do succeed in deleting more independent media sites from social media, they cannot erase them from the internet.\nYes, social media platforms were great for spreading information across the internet and for having more people become aware of it.\nIt really showed what people were interested in, and what people wanted to see, but clearly, we do not live in a democracy and that doesn\u2019t matter.\nAgainst the State: An ... Llewellyn H. Rockwell Jr. Best Price: $9.94 Buy New $9.95 (as of 01:45 EST - Details)\nPeople are still going to search for information, and alternative forms of information, given the fact that what they see coming from the mainstream is usually highly suspect and questionable.\nMore and more people see it this way because our consciousness continues to shift.\nSocial media platforms do not control the awakening but have been a great tool to grow it, but it\u2019s something that cannot be stopped.\nThe more we awaken and truly see past the political games, the more we pull power from the power grid that keeps all this in place.\n2020\nNow, all of this seems to be taking place with perfect timing before the 2020 election.\nNo doubt that the Deep State will want to take back the presidency, but ultimately, we need to see the bigger picture here.\nWe need to see what politics actually is, and the past few years alone have provided us with the opportunity to see.\nIt\u2019s nothing but elite people, corporations and the financial elite that have become drenched with so much power that they have been able to direct human will and use it for their own selfish purposes.\nWith powerful revelations that have come to light, like elite pedophilia and ritual abuse, and extreme corruption, why do we still participate?\nWhy do we choose to elect these people?\nWhy do we believe we live in a democracy when what people want to look at, and what the majority of people want to have done (like GMO-labelling), is completely censored?\nWhy are harmful \u2018things\u2019 surrounding us constantly when we have science showing it\u2019s not safe, like cell phone towers etc.\nIt\u2019s simply because power lies within the corporatocracy.\nDecisions aren\u2019t being made with the best interest of humanity at heart, and this is why the system is failing because it\u2019s not actually for the people.\nToday the path to total dictatorship in the U.S. can be laid by strictly legal means \u2026 We have a well-organized political-action group in this country, determined to destroy our Constitution and establish a one-party state \u2026 It operates secretly, silently, continuously to transform our Government \u2026 This ruthless power-seeking elite is a disease of our century\u2026 This group \u2026 is answerable neither to the President, the Congress, nor the courts.\nIt is practically irremovable.\n\u2013 Senator William Jenner (source)\nBefore 2020, they\u2019re going to want to silence anything that creates awareness about the corruption, deceit and lies that have dominated the presidency and the entire military-industrial complex for years.\nThe fact of the matter is:\n\u201cThe conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society.\nThose who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.\nWe are governed, our minds are moulded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.\u201d \u2013 Edward Bernays (\u201cthe father of public relations\u201d), Propaganda, 1928 (note that Bernays\u2019 book, Propaganda, begins with the above quote).\nThis is what\u2019s unravelling, and the stronger the push the unravel it, the stronger the reaction and response from the deep state.\nThe Takeaway\nRecognize what\u2019s happening, the massive censorship of information, coupled with the ridicule or finger pointing, or even arrest of people who choose to voice an opinion in opposition to the rhetoric that\u2019s constantly spewed by mainstream media, which in turn is usually believed by the masses.\nAt the same time, independent media represents a shift in consciousness.\nA shift in our perceptions, thoughts, feelings and general self-awareness about our own planet is changing, and thus, change has been sprouted in multiple different areas, including political corruption and the stranglehold it has over our world.\nWe are more aware, but there is still some ways to go\u2026\nA good chunk of work has been done.\nA massive transformation of consciousness has taken place and it seems that a global mass is growing closer to a critical mass.\nThe censorship of independent media is irrelevant in a sense, because the shift will continue to happen, change will continue to happen, and information that the deep state does not want the public to become aware of will keep making its way into transparency.\nIndependent media will continue to have the opportunity to share information because of a lack of credible information and plain truth within the mainstream.\nPeople are hungry for it, and will seek it out themselves.\nReprinted with permission from Collective Evolution.\n\n",

Barack Obama (D) and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan that he took in 2005 at a Congressional Black Caucus meeting, but did not make public because he believed it would have \u201cmade a difference\u201d to Obama\u2019s political future.\nThe photographer, Askia Muhammad, told the Trice Edney News Wire that he \u201cgave the picture up at the time and basically swore secrecy.\u201d \u201cBut after the nomination was secured and all the way up until the inauguration; then for eight years after he was President, it was kept under cover,\u201d Muhammad said.\nAsked whether he thought the photo\u2019s release would have affected Obama\u2019s presidential campaign, Muhammad said, \u201cI insist.\nIt absolutely would have made a difference.\u201d Reached by TPM on Thursday, Muhammad said a \u201cstaff member\u201d for the CBC contacted him \u201csort of in a panic\u201d after he took the photo at a caucus meeting in 2005.\nTPM has published the photo above with Muhammad\u2019s permission.\n\u201cI sort of understood what was going on,\u201d Muhammad told TPM.\n\u201cI promised and made arrangements to give the picture to Leonard Farrakhan,\u201d the minister\u2019s son-in-law and chief of staff.\nMuhammad said he gave away \u201cthe disk\u201d from his camera but \u201ccopied the photograph from that day onto a file\u201d on his computer.\n\u201cRealizing that I had given it up, I mean, it was sort of like a promise to keep the photograph secret,\u201d Muhammad said.\nArticle posted with permission from Pamela Geller\nPamela Geller's commitment to freedom from jihad and Shariah shines forth in her books\n\n",

        "target": "America's Immigration Voice.\n\nFrom TPM:\nThe Photo That Never Saw The Light of Day: Obama With Farrakhan In 2005 By Esme Cribb | January 25, 2018 2:16 pm A journalist announced last week that he will publish a photograph of then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama (D) and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan that he took in 2005 at a Congressional Black Caucus meeting, but did not make public because he believed it would have \u201cmade a difference\u201d to Obama\u2019s political future.\nThe photographer, Askia Muhammad, told the Trice Edney News Wire that he \u201cgave the picture up at the time and basically swore secrecy.\u201d \u201cBut after the nomination was secured and all the way up until the inauguration; then for eight years after he was President, it was kept under cover,\u201d Muhammad said.\nAsked whether he thought the photo\u2019s release would have affected Obama\u2019s presidential campaign, Muhammad said, \u201cI insist.\nIt absolutely would have made a difference.\u201d Reached by TPM on Thursday, Muhammad said a \u201cstaff member\u201d for the CBC contacted him \u201csort of in a panic\u201d after he took the photo at a caucus meeting in 2005.\nTPM has published the photo above with Muhammad\u2019s permission.\n\u201cI sort of understood what was going on,\u201d Muhammad told TPM.\n\u201cI promised and made arrangements to give the picture to Leonard Farrakhan,\u201d the minister\u2019s son-in-law and chief of staff.\nMuhammad said he gave away \u201cthe disk\u201d from his camera but \u201ccopied the photograph from that day onto a file\u201d on his computer.\n\u201cRealizing that I had given it up, I mean, it was sort of like a promise to keep the photograph secret,\u201d Muhammad said.\nMuhammad said he did not release his copy of the photograph because he thought it would be perceived as a betrayal of that promise: \u201cI was really, I guess, afraid of them.\u201d\nMalcolm X wasn\u2019t adequately afraid of them.\nHere\u2019s what happened to him:\nhttps://youtu.be/qSm1t3Uv9QI\nMuhammad said he thought the photograph would be \u201cdamaging politically\u201d if it were released and was afraid that someone might \u201cbreak into his apartment\u201d looking for it, like \u201cthat Watergate crap.\u201d He said he \u201cfelt a little bit more at ease\u201d after Farrakhan in 2016 claimed that Obama visited his home in Chicago.\nMuhammad contacted Farrakhan in autumn 2017 with the \u201cfinal manuscript\u201d for a self-published book containing the photo.\n\u201cI sent him a copy of the manuscript suggesting that, showing him the picture, and saying to him, if he did not object, I was going to publish it,\u201d Muhammad said.\n\u201cHe had no objection.\u201d \u2026 During Obama\u2019s presidential campaign, conservatives pushed multiple apparently racially motivated conspiracy theories about Obama\u2019s religion and supposed ties to Islam.\nFor example, in Obama\u2019s memoir subtitled A Story of Race and Inheritance, Obama recounts his being a regular reader of Minister Farrakhan\u2019s Nation of Islam newspaper The Final Call.\nObama recollects Farrakhan\u2019s black nationalist capitalist campaign to get black people to use toothpaste manufactured by black-owned businesses.\nFarrakhan\u2019s eventual failure suggests to Obama that\u2019s there is more economic upside for blacks in shaking down white institutions than in building their own.\nDuring the 2008 presidential election, conservatives questioned the indirect ties between Farrakhan and Obama, who attended a church that gave Farrakhan an award.\nObama\u2019s \u201cspiritual advisor\u201d Rev.\nJeremiah Wright gave Farrakhan his church\u2019s Lifetime Achievement award in a downtown Chicago Hyatt Regency in November 2007, but the story didn\u2019t make the press until the following year.\nSimilarly, very little media attention was paid to the close relationship between Obama\u2019s fundraiser and private mentor Tony Rezko and the Nation of Islam, even though Rezko\u2019s role was business manager for Nation of Islam assets, such as the career of Muhammad Ali.\nBut after all, what could be more boring than a story than involves a Presidential candidate, the Syrian Christian crook who helped him buy his house, the Nation of Islam, and the most famous boxer of all time?\nReading Obama\u2019s 1995 memoir, you might almost get the impression that after a prudent first term, during his second he might side with, I dunno, Black Lives Matter and encourage a wave of black rage and police retreat that drove up the death toll from murder by 20% in his last two years in office, an incremental death toll a little bigger than the U.S. combat death toll from the equally stupid Iraq War.\n\n",

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2018\nWe'll see how things turn out and I'm sure Senator Paul is not issuing an empty threat in the matter.\n\n",

support us with cryptocurrency donations.\nThank you!\nFor decades, Americans have known that very sick things happen behind the scenes in Washington D.C., but the mainstream media nearly really talks about any of it.\nBut now the curtain is starting to be pulled back, and the revelations about Al Franken are just the beginning.\nEarlier this week, I wrote an article about how \u201csexual harassment is rampant in the halls of Congress\u201d, and that was before a female radio anchor named LeeAnn Tweeden revealed that Al Franken had \u201cforcibly kissed\u201d and groped her during a USO tour in 2006.\nThe following comes from an article in which Tweeden shared her story\u2026\nI couldn\u2019t believe it.\nHe groped me, without my consent, while I was asleep.\nI felt violated all over again.\nEmbarrassed.\nBelittled.\nHumiliated.\nHow dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it\u2019s funny?\nI told my husband everything that happened and showed him the picture.\nI wanted to shout my story to the world with a megaphone to anyone who would listen, but even as angry as I was, I was worried about the potential backlash and damage going public might have on my career as a broadcaster.\nBut that was then, this is now.\nI\u2019m no longer afraid.\nWhen the story initially broke, Franken rushed to issue an apology\u2026\n\u201cI certainly don\u2019t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann,\u201d said Franken.\n\u201cAs to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn\u2019t.\nI shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d\nNeedless to say, many were completely unsatisfied with Franken\u2019s very weak statement.\nIn fact, some members of his own party said that his apology was entirely insufficient and are calling for Franken to be held accountable for his actions\u2026\nGuy Cecil, the former head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and now the boss of a leading Democratic super PAC, voiced his frustration with the inadequacy of Franken\u2019s apology on Twitter.\n\u201cThat was not an apology and was an insufficient response to serious allegations,\u201d Cecil tweeted.\n\u201cAl Franken must be held accountable if our party wants to live up to our commitment to women & girls.\u201d\nThis scandal has set off a feeding frenzy as Internet sleuths search for other incidents in which Franken has acted inappropriately.\nAnd of course, since we are talking about Al Franken, it wasn\u2019t exactly difficult to find material.\nFor example, a photo has surfaced of Franken grabbing Joy Behar in a very creepy manner.\nThe following comes from Breitbart\u2026\nAmid the emergence of a 2006 photo of Al Franken groping journalist and talk radio anchor Leeann Tweeden, a photo of the embattled Minnesota Senator appearing to grab comedian Joy Behar\u2019s breast has also resurfaced.\nFranken was a comedian before he ever entered the world of politics, and we understand that.\nBut just because he was a comedian does not mean that he gets to play by a different set of rules.\nThere appears to be an ongoing pattern of behavior, and Fox News has documented some of the other incidents that have come up in the past\u2026\nFranken, then a comedian, was quoted in a 1995 New York Magazine article discussing a skit for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d that involved drugging and raping CBS reporter Lesley Stahl.\nFranken, at the time a writer for \u201cSNL,\u201d suggested one skit should play out with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d commentator Andy Rooney finding an empty pill bottle on his desk.\n\u201c\u2019I give the pills to Lesley Stahl.\nThen when Lesley is passed out, I take her to the closet and rape her.\u2019 Or \u2018That\u2019s why you never see Lesley until February.\u2019 Or, \u2018When she passes out.\nI put her in various positions and take pictures of her,\u2019\u201d Franken was quoted saying.\nThe article, along with a 2000 Playboy column in which Franken talked about fantasizing a machine would perform oral sex on him, was used to attack Franken during his 2008 Senate campaign in Minnesota.\nAs much as we may be appalled by some of the things that Al Franken has done, the truth is that there are far worse offenders in Washington.\nLet\u2019s talk about Bill Clinton for a moment.\nDemocrats have been covering up his sexual crimes for years, and my hope is that now this will start to change.\nJuanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Connie Hamzy, Eileen Wellstone, Sandra Allen James, Christy Zercher, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky, Gennifer Flowers, Elizabeth Ward Gracen, Sally Perdue, Lencola Sullivan, Susie Whitacre and Bobbie Ann William are some of the women that have made allegations against Clinton, and if even half of their allegations are true Clinton should be in prison for the rest of his life.\nIn my article yesterday, I discussed how one Secret Service agent is charging former Vice-President Joe Biden of engaging in \u201cWeinstein-level\u201d behavior, and I also talked about how 15 million dollars in settlements have been secretly paid out to victims of sexual harassment in the House of Representatives in recent years.\nThere is a culture of corruption in Washington D.C., and we desperately need to drain the swamp.\nIf you agree, I hope that you will support my campaign and the campaigns of other anti-establishment candidates that want to clean up the halls of Congress.\nIt is time to take our government back because at this point it has become an absolutely disgusting cesspool of filth and corruption.\nArticle posted with permission from End of the American Dream\n\n",

Kelly of Washington, D.C., who was appointed by Trump, ruled against the administration and ordered Acosta\u2019s hard pass restored for 14 days, pending further hearings in the lawsuit.\nBut it was not a vindication of Acosta\u2019s free speech rights under the First Amendment.\nThe judge specifically said that the First Amendment claim made by Acosta and CNN had not yet been adjudicated and added that the president was free not to call on Acosta at future press conferences.\nThe temporary restraining order was nowhere to be found online at press time, but according to media reports, Kelly found that the administration violated Acosta\u2019s due process rights under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\nThe White House vowed to remedy the situation by drawing up rules governing press conferences.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice said the court ruling was disappointing.\n\u201cThe President has broad authority to regulate access to the White House, including to ensure fair and orderly White House events and press conferences.\nWe look forward to continuing to defend the White House's lawful actions.\"\nAcosta ignorantly blathered on to reporters when he returned to the White House Friday after the court ruling, incorrectly claiming he won a great First Amendment victory.\n\"I'm very grateful for what happened today,\" Acosta said.\n\"I'm grateful for my colleagues in the press who stood by us through all of this.\"\n\"This was a test and I think we passed the test,\" he said.\n\"Journalists need to know that in this country their First Amendment rights of freedom of the press are sacred, they're protected in our Constitution,\" Acosta said.\n\"Throughout all of this I was confident and I thought that this would be the result at the end of the day that our rights would be protected as we continue to cover our government and hold our leaders accountable.\"\nThe court case isn\u2019t over yet.\nThe legal antagonists have to report to the court Monday afternoon.\nThe court ordered the parties to \u201cfile a joint status report proposing how they would like to proceed in this case by 3:00 p.m. on November 19, 2018[,]\u201d according to its online docket.\nAccording to CNN, \u201cWhite House officials sent Acosta a letter stating that his pass is set to be suspended again once the restraining order expires.\u201d\nFrom the looks of the letter, the W.H.\nis trying to establish a paper trail that will empower the administration to boot Acosta again at the end of the month.\nCNN responded with this statement on Sunday: \"The White House is continuing to violate the First and 5th Amendments of the Constitution.\nThese actions threaten all journalists and news organizations.\nJim Acosta and CNN will continue to report the news about the White House and the President.\"\nThe Acosta-CNN lawsuit was filed by Ted Boutrous and Trump-hating Republican lawyer Ted Olson, of the law firm Gibson, Dunn, and Crutcher.\nOlson was solicitor general in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration.\n(The legal complaint may be viewed here.)\nBoutrous said CNN is prepared to dig in for a protracted legal fight if it needs to.\n\"We're ready to litigate as long as we have to, to protect these First Amendment rights, to ask the court to declare rules of the road going forward,\" he said.\n\n",

Lee Merritt, Esq.\n(@MeritLaw) September 17, 2018\n\u201cThe officer responsible for the completely unjustifiable shooting death of O\u2019Shea Terry has been returned to light duty and has faced no criminal charges whatsoever.\nThe officer who shot and killed Botham Jean remains on the Dallas police force and was able to bond out on manslaughter charges in a fraction of the time the protestors have spent in jail,\u201d Merritt said in a statement.\nMerrit cast suspicion on the police for intentionally keeping these protestors in jail to send a message and make an example out of them.\nThe reaction from the police, in this case, has shown that they believe they have a license to kill and that they cannot be trusted to monitor themselves and keep one another in check.\nThey have no interest in serving justice when it comes to enforcing crimes against their own.\nArticle posted with permission from John Vibes.\n\n",

        "target": "Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook\n\nFollowing what has appeared for months to be a strained relationship between President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the top diplomat is being replaced.\nTrump announced Tillerson\u2019s ouster via Twitter Tuesday, saying: \u201cMike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State.\nHe will do a fantastic job!\nThank you to Rex Tillerson for his service!\nGina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen.\nCongratulations to all!\u201d\nThis is yet another big shake-up for Trump\u2019s still-young administration \u2014 and it may be the most important one to date.\nThe move creates some big questions about both the administration\u2019s foreign policy ambitions as well as the president\u2019s relationship with the deep state.\nIf you enjoyed Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as Secretary of State, you\u2019ll like Pompeo\u2019s.\nLike Clinton and her Democrat allies, Pompeo has long subscribed to the belief that Russia is perpetually meddling in U.S. affairs.\nIn fact, he believes Barack Obama got Russian help too.\nWhile he was being confirmed as CIA chief, the former lawmaker lashed out at Russia for reasserting \u201d itself aggressively, invading and occupying Ukraine, threatening Europe, and doing nearly nothing to aid in the destruction and defeat of ISIS.\u201d\nAgain, if you liked Obama-era, world-on-fire, Russians everywhere State Department shenanigans, this is your guy.\nPompeo also isn\u2019t a huge fan of calling the federal government out when it is clearly violating the rights of Americans, as shown by his statements last year regarding WikiLeaks.\n\u201cIt is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is \u2013 a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia.\nIn January of this year, our Intelligence Community determined that Russian military intelligence \u2014 the GRU \u2014 had used WikiLeaks to release data of U.S. victims that the GRU had obtained through cyber operations against the Democratic National Committee.\nAnd the report also found that Russia\u2019s primary propaganda outlet, RT, has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks,\u201d he said.\nPompeo favors increased U.S. involvement in Syria (hello, Russian proxy war), ratcheting pressure on Iran and regime change in North Korea.\nClinton City\u2026\nMoving on to Haspel, who will now be heading the CIA, nothing\u2019s looking any brighter.\nShe\u2019s a big fan of torture, according to a 2013 Washington Post article pointed out this morning by The Intercept:\nIN MAY 2013, the Washington Post\u2019s Greg Miller reported that the head of the CIA\u2019s clandestine service was being shifted out of that position as a result of \u201ca management shake-up\u201d by then-Director John Brennan.\nAs Miller documented, this official \u2014 whom the paper did not name because she was a covert agent at the time \u2014 was centrally involved in the worst abuses of the CIA\u2019s Bush-era torture regime.\nAs Miller put it, she was \u201cdirectly involved in its controversial interrogation program\u201d and had an \u201cextensive role\u201d in torturing detainees.\nEven more troubling, she \u201chad run a secret prison in Thailand\u201d \u2014 part of the CIA\u2019s network of \u201cblack sites\u201d \u2014 \u201cwhere two detainees were subjected to waterboarding and other harsh techniques.\u201d The Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s report on torture also detailed the central role she played in the particularly gruesome torture of detainee Abu Zubaydah.\nBeyond all that, she played a vital role in the destruction of interrogation videotapes that showed the torture of detainees both at the black site she ran and other secret agency locations.\nThe concealment of those interrogation tapes, which violated multiple court orders as well as the demands of the 9/11 commission and the advice of White House lawyers, was condemned as \u201cobstruction\u201d by commission chairs Lee Hamilton and Thomas Keane.\nA special prosecutor and grand jury investigated those actions but ultimately chose not to prosecute.\nBottom line, George W. Bush/Barack Obama era foreign policy and intelligence doctrines aren\u2019t going anywhere under Trump.\n\n",

Kelly was nothing but surreal, and honestly, he should be impeached over his frivolous ruling that demanded the White House reinstate CNN reporter Jim Acosta's press pass.\nHowever, the White House has decided to comply, which I wonder just how dangerous a precedent this sets, and as a result, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders has issued a code of conduct for the White House press.\nWe have created these rules with a degree of regret,\u201d Sanders said in a statement.\nThe fact that the White House submitted to such a ridiculous demand when it is simple human decency to conduct one's self in a proper manner, unlike how Jim Acosta treated both Sarah Sanders, President Donald Trump and a White House aide, is a testimony to how little those who represent us know of our Constitution.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nShould Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?\nShould Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?\nShould Jim Acosta have gotten his press pass back?\n* Yes, he should have gotten it back.\nNo, you can't act like a child and keep your pass.\nMaybe?\nI'm not sure if he should have.\nEmail *\nEmail This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\n\u201cWe would have greatly preferred to continue hosting White House press conferences in reliance on a set of understood professional norms, and we believe the overwhelming majority of journalists covering the White House share that preference,\u201d Sanders said.\n\u201cBut, given the position taken by CNN, we now feel obligated to replace previously shared practices with explicit rules.\u201d\nOh, but there's more.\nIf journalists can't conduct themselves according to these rules, then there is no other option but to.... write more explicit rules!\nSeriously!\n\u201cAt this time, however, we have decided not to frame such rules in the hope that professional journalistic norms will suffice to regulate conduct in those places,\u201d Sanders said.\n\u201cIf unprofessional behavior occurs in those settings, or if a court should decide that explicit rules are required to regulate conduct there, we will be forced to reconsider this decision.\u201d\nThe White House should be telling Judge Kelly where he can take his ruling, but they are trying to look like they are on the high ground while submitting to unconstitutional rulings from a federal judge who should know better.\nHowever, here are the new rules released by the White House Press Office.\n(1) A journalist called upon to ask a question will ask a single question and then will yield the floor to other journalists; (2) At the discretion of the President or other White House official taking questions, a follow-up question or questions may be permitted; and where a follow up has been allowed and asked, the questioner will then yield the floor; (3) \u201cYielding the floor\u201d includes, when applicable, physically surrendering the microphone to White House staff for use by the next questioner; (4) Failure to abide by any of rules (1)-(3) may result in suspension or revocation of the journalist\u2019s hard pass.\nI can see this going way downhill.\nIf you want to deal with people like Acosta, at the moment they begin to show who and what they really are, stop calling on them for questions.\nThis is my advice to the White House.\nDon't call on Jim Acosta another time for as long as he remains in the White House Press.\nMake him regret it the entire time he is there.\n\n",

        "target": "THE OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS OF TRUMP'S IRAN INITIATIVE\n\nOriginally published the Jerusalem Post.\nOn Friday, US President Donald Trump initiated an important change in US policy toward Iran.\n\nNo, in his speech decertifying Iran\u2019s compliance with the nuclear accord it struck with his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump didn\u2019t announce a new strategy for preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, or stemming its hegemonic rise in the Middle East, or limiting its ability to sponsor terrorism.\nTrump\u2019s move was not operational.\nIt was directional.\n\nIn his address Friday, Trump changed the policy dynamics that dictate US policy on Iran.\nFor the first time since 2009, when Obama backed the murderous regime in Tehran, spurning the millions of Iranians who rose up in the Green Revolution, Trump opened up the possibility that the US may begin to base its policies toward Iran on reality.\n\nTrump began his remarks by setting out Iran\u2019s long rap sheet of aggression against America.\n\nStarting with the US embassy seizure and hostage crisis, Trump described Iran\u2019s crimes and acts of war against America in greater detail than any of his predecessors ever did.\n\nTrump\u2019s dossier was interlaced with condemnations of the regime\u2019s repression of its own people.\n\nBy merging Iran\u2019s external aggression with its internal repression, Trump signaled a readiness to drive a wedge \u2013 or expand the wedge \u2013 between the authoritarian theocrats that rule Iran and the largely secular, multiethnic and pro-Western people of Iran.\n\nTrump then turned his attention to Iran\u2019s illicit ballistic missile program, its sponsorship of terrorism, including its links to al-Qaida, its aggression against its neighbors, its aggressive acts against maritime traffic in the Straits of Hormuz, and its bids to destabilize and control large swaths of the Middle East through its proxies.\n\nIt is notable that these remarks preceded Trump\u2019s discussion of the nuclear deal \u2013 which was the ostensible subject of his speech.\nBefore Trump discussed Iran\u2019s breaches of the nuclear deal, he first demonstrated that contrary to the expressed views of his top advisers, it is impossible to limit a realistic discussion of the threat Iran constitutes to US national security and interests to whether or not and it what manner it is breaching the nuclear accord.\n\nThis was a critical point because for the past two years, US discourse on Iran has focused solely on whether or not Iran was complying with Obama\u2019s nuclear pact.\nBy placing the nuclear deal in the context of Iran\u2019s consistent, overarching hostility and aggression, Trump made it self-evident that no US interest is served in continuing to give Iran a free pass from congressional sanctions.\n\nAfter accomplishing that goal, Trump turned his attention to how Iran is actually breaching the letter and spirit of the nuclear pact.\nOnly then, almost as an afterthought, did he announce that he was decertifying Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal, setting the conditions for the renewal of congressional sanctions on Iran and opening the floodgates of congressional sanctions on Iran in retaliation for the full spectrum of its aggressive and illicit acts against the US, its interests and allies.\n\nBy empowering Congress to prohibit economic cooperation with Iran, Trump put the Europeans, Chinese and Russians on notice that they may soon face a choice between conducting business with the US and conducting business with Iran.\n\nAfter putting them on notice, Trump discussed the possibility of improving Obama\u2019s nuclear accord.\nAmong other things, he suggested expanding the inspection regime against Iran\u2019s nuclear installations and canceling the so-called \u201csunset\u201d clause that places an end date on the restrictions governing certain components of Iran\u2019s nuclear advancement.\n\nTrump\u2019s address has the potential to serve as the foundation of a major, positive shift in US policy toward Iran.\nSuch a shift could potentially facilitate the achievement of Trump\u2019s goals of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, containing its regional aggression and empowerment and defeating its terrorist proxies.\n\nUnfortunately, it is also likely, indeed, it is more likely, that his words will not be translated into policies to achieve these critical aims.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to transfer immediate responsibility to Congress for holding Iran accountable for its hostile actions on the military and other fronts is a risky move.\nHe has a lot of enemies, and the nuclear deal has a lot of supporters on Capitol Hill.\n\nObama would have never been able to implement his nuclear deal if Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, hadn\u2019t agreed to cast the Constitution aside and ignore Obama\u2019s constitutional duty to present the nuclear deal to the Senate for ratification as a treaty.\n\nOver the past week, Trump and Corker have been involved in an ugly public fight precipitated by Corker\u2019s announcement that he will not be seeking reelection next year.\n\nToday Corker has nothing to restrain him from scuttling Trump\u2019s agenda.\nIf he wishes, out of spite, Corker can block effective sanctions from being passed.\nAnd he may do so even though the implications for his Senate colleagues would be dire and even though doing so would render him an unofficial protector of Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nWhat is true for Corker is doubly true for the Democrats.\n\nLeading Democratic senators like Robert Menendez, Ben Cardin and Chuck Schumer, who opposed Obama\u2019s Iran deal may now feel that as opponents of the Trump administration, they are required to oppose any change to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.\n\nIndeed, given the rise of radical forces in their party it is likely that they would rather give Iran a free pass for its anti-American aggression and nuclear proliferation than work with Republicans on Capitol Hill and in the White House.\n\nThen again, by framing the issue of Iran\u2019s threat to America as he did, and by transferring responsibility for reinstating sanctions and passing further sanctions on Iran to Congress, Trump opened up the possibility that Congress will conduct substantive \u2013 rather than personal \u2013 debates on Iran.\n\nAnd the more substantive those debates become, the further away the US discourse will move from the mendacious assumptions of Obama\u2019s Iran policy \u2013 that the Iranian regime is a responsible actor and potential US ally, and that there is nothing inherently aggressive or problematic about Iran\u2019s illicit nuclear weapons program.\n\nThe second major risk inherent in Trump\u2019s approach is that he will get his way; that the Europeans, Russians and Chinese and the Iranians will agree to improve the nuclear deal.\nThe problem here is not obvious.\nClearly, it is better if the deal is amended to delete the sunset clauses and expand the inspections regime.\n\nYet even an amended, improved deal will still serve as a shield to Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nAn improved deal won\u2019t destroy Iran\u2019s centrifuges.\n\nIt won\u2019t take away Iran\u2019s enriched uranium.\nIt won\u2019t destroy Iran\u2019s nuclear installations.\nAnd it won\u2019t bring down the regime which by its nature ensures all of these things will remain a menace to the US, its allies and international security as a whole.\n\nSo long as the US continues to maintain a policy based on the false view that all that is necessary to destroy the threat of a nuclear armed Iran is a combination of the nuclear deal and economic sanctions, it will continue to ensure that Iran and its nuclear program remain a major threat.\nDistressingly, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, the most outspoken supporter of decertifying Iranian compliance in the Trump administration, told NBC on Sunday that the US intends to remain in the nuclear deal.\n\nTo understand what must be done we must return to Trump\u2019s speech and its strategic significance.\n\nBy taking a holistic view of the Iranian threat \u2013 grounded in a recognition of the inherent hostility of the regime \u2013 Trump opened up the possibility that the US and its allies can develop a holistic policy for confronting and defeating Iran and its proxies.\nIf the Iran deal and sanctions are two components to a larger strategy rather than the entire strategy, they can be helpful.\n\nA wider strategy would target Iran\u2019s regional aggression by weakening its proxies and clients from Hezbollah and Hamas to the regimes in Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon.\nIt would target the regime itself by empowering the ayatollahs\u2019 domestic opponents.\nIt would pin down Iranian forces by arming and otherwise assisting the Iraqi Kurds to defend and maintain their control over their territory along the Iranian border while strengthening the ties between Iranian Kurds and Iraqi Kurds.\n\nFriday, Trump created the possibility for such a strategy.\nIt is up to members of Congress, and US allies like Israel and the Sunni Arab states to help Trump conceive and implement it.\nIf they fail, the possibility Trump created will be lost, perhaps irrevocably.\n\n",

        "target": "Court orders White House to restore CNN correspondent Jim Acosta\u2019s press credential\n\nCNN has won the first round of its legal battle to get correspondent Jim Acosta back in the White House.\nU.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly granted the cable news network\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction Friday that restored Acosta\u2019s White House press credential.\nKelly ordered that Acosta be reinstated immediately.\nHe did not rule on CNN\u2019s claim that the revocation of the journalist\u2019s pass violated his rights under the First Amendment.\nBut he said the White House did not provide Acosta with due process to legally remove his pass.\nThe ruling followed a court hearing held Wednesday in Washington, where lawyers for CNN and the White House faced off over the issue of press access.\nCNN had the broad support of other news organizations that believed the White House\u2019s actions posed a challenge to press freedom.\n\u201cWe are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days,\u201d a CNN representative said in a statement.\n\u201cOur sincere thanks to all who have supported not just CNN, but a free, strong and independent American press.\u201d\nThe White House said it would abide by Kelly\u2019s ruling.\n\u201cToday, the court made clear there is no absolute right to access the White House.\nIn response to the court, we will temporarily reinstate the reporter\u2019s hard pass,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.\n\u201cWe will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future.\nThere must be decorum in the White House.\u201d\nAcosta\u2019s press credential was revoked by the White House on Nov. 7 after a testy exchange with President Donald Trump at a White House news conference.\nAt one point, Acosta refused to relinquish the microphone to a White House aide who tried to retrieve it from him.\nIt was the latest in a series of public confrontations between Acosta and Trump, who has repeatedly characterized CNN\u2019s critical coverage of him as \u201cfake news\u201d since the 2016 presidential campaign.\nCNN\u2019s suit filed Tuesday says the suspension of Acosta\u2019s credential violates the First Amendment\u2019s protection of free speech.\nIt also says the way the administration revoked the pass, with no direct notice to Acosta or a written explanation detailing the decision, violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s protection of due process and the federal Administrative Procedures Act.\n\u201cThis severe and unprecedented punishment is the culmination of years of hostility by President Trump against CNN and Acosta based on the contents of their reporting \u2014 an unabashed attempt to censor the press and exclude reporters from the White House who challenge and dispute the president\u2019s point of view,\u201d the suit says.\nResponding to the CNN suit, lawyers for the White House said the Trump administration had broad discretion to regulate access to journalists and other members of the public.\n\u201cIf the president wants to exclude all reporters from the White House grounds, he has the authority to do that,\u201d Deputy Assistant Attorney General James Burnham said during the hearing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no First Amendment right.\u201d\nThe White House argued that Acosta\u2019s behavior, which it described as rude and aggressive, was the reason for revoking his credential.\nMark Lukasiewicz, dean of The Lawrence Herbert School of Communication at Hofstra University and a former network news executive, praised the judge\u2019s decision, which he said was not a surprise.\n\u201cThe White House has lots of other ways to deal with the behavior of reporters if that\u2019s their concern, but closing the gate to a news organization is not one of these ways, and it\u2019s important that the court stood up and said that,\u201d Lukasiewicz said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time a reporter has behaved in a way that a president doesn\u2019t like.\u201d\nLukasiewicz believed CNN would reach a compromise with the White House rather than engage in a prolonged court battle.\n\u201cThe law and the Constitution is very clear here,\u201d he said.\nCNN\u2019s suit received the support of more than a dozen news organizations including Fox News, where commentators have often echoed Trump\u2019s criticisms of the network\u2019s coverage.\nRival news organizations came to the defense of Fox News in 2009 when the Obama administration attempted to exclude its reporters from interviews with officials that were offered to all other outlets.\nFox News commentators were President Barack Obama\u2019s harshest critics during his eight years in office, and he often complained about it in public and private.\nBut the press credentials for its conservative-leaning network were never revoked.\nFox News, The Washington Post, NBC News, The Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times are among the entities that have said they will file amicus briefs on behalf of CNN.\n\u2014 Stephen Battaglio\nLos Angeles Times\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a92018 Los Angeles Times, Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n\n",

        "target": "Kerry On Edge As Legacy Crumbles\n\nFormer Secretary of State John Kerry wasted no time condemning President Trump\u2019s decision not to recertify, and to possibly withdraw from, the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran that Kerry negotiated on behalf of his boss Barack Obama.\nPresident Trump insisted on significant improvements to the Joint Plan of Comprehensive Action (JCPOA), as the deal is formally known.\nThe JCPOA\u2019s fundamental flaws that President Trump wants fixed include Iran\u2019s ability to block unfettered international inspections, the wiggle room that Iran is exploiting to continue developing and testing ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and the sunset clause on nuclear enrichment that would provide Iran a clear path to becoming a nuclear armed state after the current restrictions are lifted.\nObama and Kerry had promised that these issues would be dealt with satisfactorily before agreeing to the final terms of the JCPOA.\nInstead they caved to Iranian pressure in order to get the deal done.\nNow that President Trump is trying to clean up the mess Obama and Kerry left him, Kerry has the gall to label President Trump\u2019s decision a \"reckless abandonment of facts in favor of ego and ideology\" and to accuse the Trump administration of \u201clying to the American people.\u201d It was the Obama administration that recklessly abandoned the facts in pressing ahead with the deal.\nThe Obama administration lied to the American people, abandoning its own promises to ensure that the deal contained ironclad protections.\nMoreover, all that President Trump has done so far is to return the JCPOA to Congress for review.\nHad Obama followed the Constitution and submitted the JCPOA to the Senate as a treaty in the first place, the JCPOA in its present form almost certainly would not have been approved.\nCongress should now have the opportunity to revisit the JCPOA to determine whether the protections that the Obama administration promised are working as advertised.\nCongress should also consider whether time limits on Iran\u2019s commitments continue to make sense in light of what we are now experiencing with Iran\u2019s nuclear technology collaborator, North Korea.\nIt bought time to turn into a full-fledged nuclear power under our noses.\nKerry had promised that the Iranian regime would be prohibited from testing ballistic missiles.\nThis turned out to be a lie.\nAfter the JCPOA was finalized, with no such prohibition included, Iran continued to test such missiles.\nThe Obama administration\u2019s response was that the missiles had become a separate issue, to be dealt with under a new United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the JCPOA.\nThe new resolution replaced clear prohibitions imposed on Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program with a weak declaration in an annex that simply \u201ccalls upon\u201d Iran not to undertake any activity such as development and test launches related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons for eight years.\nIran has tested several ballistic missiles during the last two years, including two Qadr H missiles with the phrase \u201cIsrael must be wiped out\u201d emblazoned on the sides.\nThe commander of Iran\u2019s Army, Major General Ataollah Salehi, had told reporters just a month before the launch of those missiles that Iran was \"neither paying any attention to the resolutions against Iran, nor implementing them.\nThis is not a breach of the JCPOA.\u201d\nRussian Ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin, spurning requests from Obama administration officials to impose sanctions against Iran under the Security Council resolution, asserted that the Iranian missile test did not violate the resolution.\n\u201cA call is different from a ban so legally you cannot violate a call, you can comply with a call or you can ignore the call, but you cannot violate a call,\u201d the Russian ambassador said.\nIn short, the JCPOA did not cover the missile tests and the replacement UN Security Council resolution that did mention the missiles is toothless.\nDeputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes told CNN, during an interview aired on April 6, 2015, that under the deal\u2019s terms then still being negotiated, \u201cyou will have anywhere, anytime, 24/7 access as it relates to the nuclear facilities that Iran has.\"\nRhodes claimed that \u201cif we see a site that we need to inspect on a military facility, we can get access to that site and inspect it.\nSo if it's a suspicious site that we believe is related to its nuclear efforts, we can get access and inspect that site through the IAEA.\u201d This was another lie.\nAfter the JCPOA was finalized in July 2015, Rhodes shamelessly denied that anytime, anywhere inspections were ever considered as part of the negotiations.\n\u201cWe never sought in this negotiation the capacity for so-called anytime, anywhere,\u201d Rhodes said on July 14, 2015.\nThe JCPOA\u2019s supporters, including Kerry, have made much of the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has on several occasions verified Iran\u2019s compliance with its commitments under the JCPOA, keeping its stock of low-enriched uranium below the limit set forth in the JCPOA and not pursuing further construction of the Arak reactor.\nIran was found to have slightly exceeded the limit on its stock of heavy water, but has remedied the problem to the IAEA\u2019s satisfaction.\nIAEA chief Yukiya Amano reiterated in a statement he issued on October 9th that Iran has remained in compliance with its JCPOA commitments.\nThe problem, as any clear-eyed observer of the process recognizes, is that the IAEA relies on Iran for self-inspection of certain sites that the regime does not want the IAEA to inspect freely on its own.\nIAEA inspectors have avoided examining military sites it knows exists and has no reliable way of tracking undeclared sites.\nThe IAEA\u2019s explanation for not visiting any of Iran\u2019s known military sites is that it had \u201cno reason to ask\u201d for access.\nEvidently, the IAEA is supposed to block out the fact that Iran had conducted tests relevant to nuclear bomb detonations at a military site before the JCPOA\u2019s finalization in 2015.\nThe IAEA should just pretend that such tests could not possibly happen again.\n\u201cNobody is allowed to visit Iran's military sites,\u201d said Iran\u2019s Head of Strategic Research Center at the Expediency Council and adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, Ali Akbar Velayati.\nIntimidation works.\nThe IAEA knows not to ask.\nAs to the JCPOA\u2019s sunset provisions, the Obama administration lied about that too.\nKerry claimed on September 2, 2015 that the JCPOA \u201cnever sunsets.\nThere\u2019s no sunset in this agreement.\u201d\nThis month Kerry has resorted to parsing words.\nHe claims the phrase 'sunset provisions' is a \u201cmisnomer,\u201d before then defending the JCPOA\u2019s time limits.\n\"We were comfortable because the cap on Iran\u2019s low-enriched uranium stockpile remains in place until 2030,\u201d Kerry wrote in an article published in the Washington Post late last month.\nIn other words, let\u2019s just kick the can down the road and hope for a more reasonable Iranian regime in 13 years that would agree to extend the time limits.\nIn the meantime, Kerry advises us not to worry.\nKerry declared, \u201c15 or 25 years from now, we still have the same military options we have today.\u201d\nJohn Kerry has obviously learned nothing from the North Korean fiasco, which resulted from years of phony agreements with the rogue regime and so-called \u201cstrategic patience.\u201d The United States clearly does not have the same military options today to deal with a nuclear armed North Korea as it did 23 years ago when former President Bill Clinton decided not to use military force to stamp out North Korea\u2019s nuclear program at its inception.\nInstead, Clinton started us down the primrose path of na\u00efve diplomacy with a duplicitous regime that now is on the verge of being able to strike the U.S. mainland with nuclear warheads delivered by intercontinental ballistic missiles.\nIt is precisely because North Korea\u2019s actions over the last 23 years have proven that making concessions to a rogue regime in order to obtain denuclearization commitments is so dangerous that President Trump does not want to make the same mistake with Iran.\nAmerica\u2019s European allies are also upset with President Trump for refusing to recertify the deal and threatening to pull out if certain conditions are not met.\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a joint statement last Friday praising the JCPOA and its implementation.\nThey said that the nuclear deal with Iran was \u201cthe culmination of 13 years of diplomacy and was a major step towards ensuring that Iran\u2019s nuclear programme is not diverted for military purposes.\nTherefore, we encourage the US Administration and Congress to consider the implications to the security of the US and its allies before taking any steps that might undermine the JCPOA, such as re-imposing sanctions on Iran lifted under the agreement.\u201d\nPerhaps these European leaders should remember their own history.\nAppeasement through phony deals with a rogue dictatorship does not work, as proven by the infamous Munich Pact signed by British and French Prime Ministers Neville Chamberlain and Edouard Daladier with German Chancellor Adolf Hitler seventy-nine years ago.\n\n",

Defense Distributed over his 3D-print gun plans being lawful.\nThe DOJ surrendered in the matter and accepted the fact that the plans are protected under the First Amendment.\nHowever, a federal judge, in a lawsuit brought by eight states and the District of Columbia, has blocked the plans from being released.\nThe judge should understand that these plans are protected under the First Amendment in the same way that any other printed material is, and that there is no crime that has been committed by making them available to people online.\nSecond, if that were not enough, we already know that the Second Amendment protects actual arms from restriction and the right to keep and bear them from infringement.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to

*\nComments This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nFox News has the story:\nU.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik issued the order a day after eight states sued the government to block a settlement reached by the Trump administration last month allowing a Texas-based company, Defense Distributed, to resume online-sharing of blueprints for the 3D firearms.\nThe company was set to allow downloads on Wednesday, although blueprints have been posted since Friday.\nThe temporary restraining order blocks the release until the next scheduled hearing on August 10.\nIn the meantime, Congressional Democrats have urged President Trump to reverse the decision letting Defense Distributed publish the plans.\nTrump said Tuesday that he's \"looking into\" the idea, saying making 3D plastic guns available to the public \"doesn't seem to make much sense!\"\nDoesn't make much sense?\nAre you people serious?\nWhy, yes, yes they are serious.\nDeadly serious.\nIt makes perfect sense when you have the same people who have absolutely no problem with mothers hiring hitmen to murder their babies in their wombs in the most brutal and barbaric fashion, and then sell off their body parts for profit, if they don't throw them in the trash or flush them down a toilet, calling for computer files to be kept by the government and not be allowed to be released to the public.\nThe eight states are the usual suspects, along with the District of Columbia, and we should note which ones they are.\nWashington\nConnecticut\nMaryland\nNew Jersey\nNew York\nOregon\nMassachusetts\nPennsylvania\nWashington's Attorney General Bob Ferguson's office claims the settlement is:\n...in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act....there is no indication in the settlement agreement or elsewhere that any analysis, study or determination was made by the government defendants in consultation with other agencies, before the federal government agreed to lift export controls on the downloadable guns.\nIn fact, the agreement states that it \"does not reflect any agreed-upon purpose other than the desire of the Parties to reach a full and final conclusion of the Action, and to resolve the Action without the time and expense of further litigation.\"\nThe lawsuit also argues the settlement violates the Tenth Amendment by infringing on states' rights to regulate firearms.\nWashington has a robust regulatory system meant to keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals.\nThat system is jeopardized by the Trump Administration's action and will be undermined by the distribution of Defense Distributed's downloadable guns.\nNote that Ferguson forgets that the Tenth Amendment states plainly:\nThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n(emphasis mine)\nSince our founders clearly said that our rights come from our Creator, and the Second Amendment acknowledges that the \"right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,\" I truly wonder where he gets this idea the state has a right to do just that, infringe on the rights of the people by regulating firearms.\nhe is reading something into it that is simply not there, but that's a Communist ideology you are seeing there, not an American one.\nReason reports on the response of Defense Distributed:\nJosh Blackman, one of Defense Distributed's lawyers, said in an email today that \"The District Court in Washington already approved the settlement.\nThis latest suit is another collateral attack on a rule-making process that began in the Obama Administration.\"\nAs reported yesterday, Defense Distributed is already embroiled in its own lawsuit against New Jersey and Los Angeles over those authorities' threats, and simultaneously is fighting Pennsylvania's request for a temporary restraining order against them.\n(Both those states are also part of today's federal lawsuit filed in the Western District of Washington.)\nWhile the various court filings about this continue to suggest that August 1 is the date on which Defense Distributed will begin distributing the files\u2014which, again, the settlement legally permits them to do\u2014the distribution is already happening.\nCody Wilson of Defense Distributed is already fundraising off the suit via Twitter.\nHe told me five years ago, when I was writing a feature story on the beginnings of his fight with the government over gun-making files, that \"This has been a continuous process of different levels of authority figures trying to stop it from happening and thus allowing it to happen...Of course we are going to succeed\u2014because you all are trying to stop me.\nThat seemed natural and ended up being true.\"\nSo far, that has continued to be true.\nThis federal judge should know what the Constitution actually says and should have tossed this frivolous lawsuit in the trash where it belongs.\nInstead, he is demonstrating he is not even fit to sit on the bench, and the attorney generals of each of these states are demonstrating they are not fit to be in the office they are in.\nSpeaking of Defense Distributed and Cody Wilson, enter to win this Ghost Gunner 2 and make your own guns at home!\n\n",

Renee Hall terminated Police Officer Amber Guyger, #10702, during a hearing held September 24, 2018,\u201d the statement read.\n\u201cAn Internal Affairs investigation concluded that on September 9, 2018, Officer Guyger, #10702, engaged in adverse conduct when she was arrested for Manslaughter.\u201d\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\n* John Bolton Richard Grenell Dina Powell Heather Nauert Ivanka Trump\nEmail *\nEmail This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nThe department then went on to note that Guyger could appeal this firing under their civil service rules.\nOfficer Guyger was terminated for her actions.\nShe was hired in November 2013 and was assigned to the Southeast Patrol Division.\nUnder civil service rules, Officer Guyger has the right to appeal her discipline.\nThis move is noteworthy as the department has been standing up against those who have been calling for the officer to be fired.\nAs recently as Friday, Hall refused to fire Guyger, saying in part, \u201cThere is one overriding reason that I have not taken any administrative or employment action against Officer Amber Guyger.\nI don\u2019t want to interfere with the on-going criminal investigation into her actions.\u201d\nAlso, in a town hall meeting last week, Hall again stood behind her choice to refuse to fire Guyger, claiming it would be against the law.\n\u201cI can\u2019t do that because there are both local, state and federal laws that prohibit me from taking action.\nThere are civil service laws we have to adhere to,\u201d said Hall.\nApparently, it is no longer against the law.\nThis news will likely be well received by the Jean family as well as the activists who have been calling for justice for Botham since the beginning.\nAs TFTP previously reported, the idea of not firing Guyger seemed utterly preposterous as she admitted to doing something wrong.\nWhile controversy swarms the case of why she may have killed Jean, there is no doubt that she did kill him.\nThis is a fact.\nThis public servant walked into an innocent man\u2019s home and shot him dead.\nBecause of her actions, this man no longer lives.\nThis alone should have been enough to fire her.\nSurprisingly enough, NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch responded to the firing of Guyger with one word, \u201cGood,\u201d showing her support for the move.\nFor those who don\u2019t recall, Loesch sparked controversy earlier this month by claiming that if Botham Jean were a gun owner, he may be alive today.\nIndeed, as TFTP reported over the weekend, a father in Prince George\u2019s County opened fire on officers as they wrongly entered his apartment.\nHe shot two officers.\nNot only was he not arrested, but the police chief praised him and apologized.\nIn response to Guyger\u2019s termination, the family\u2019s attorney, Lee Merritt noted that the family expressed \u201csatisfaction\u201d with the move.\n\u201cThe Jean family expressed satisfaction in this explanation and in Guyger\u2019s termination.\nWe see it as an initial victory \u2014 well received on the day Botham Jean is laid to rest in his native country in St. Lucia,\u201d Merritt\u2019s office said in a statement, adding that they are committed to see a \u201cproper murder indictment, conviction and appropriate sentencing.\u201d\nArticle posted with permission from The Free Thought Project\n\n",

Lasnik in Seattle.\nThe injunction extends a ruling last month that barred the Trump administration from taking steps that would allow the firm Defense Distributed to disseminate 3D gun blueprints.\n\u201cWhen the Trump Administration inexplicably gave the green light to distribute on the internet blueprints of 3D-printed, untraceable ghost guns, it needlessly endangered our children, our loved ones and our men and women in law enforcement,\u201d Becerra said in a statement.\n\u201cThe Trump Administration\u2019s actions were dangerous and incompetent.\u201d\nThe action Monday keeps in place a July 31 court decision blocking the Trump administration pending a decision on the merits of a lawsuit by states opposed to the blueprints being published.\n\u201cThe Court finds that the irreparable burdens on the private defendants\u2019 First Amendment rights are dwarfed by the irreparable harms the States are likely to suffer if the existing restrictions are withdrawn and that, overall, the public interest strongly supports maintaining the status quo through the pendency of this litigation,\u201d Lasnik wrote in his decision.\n\u2014 Patrick McGreevy\nLos Angeles Times\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a92018 Los Angeles Times, Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nThe radical leftist gun grabbing anti-liberty California General Xavier Becerra is lying when he says the \u201cTrump Administration inexplicably gave the green light to distribute on the internet blueprints of 3D-printed, untraceable ghost guns.\u201d The Department of Just(Us) settled a 1st Amendment claim filed by Cody Wilson, who created the code for 3-D guns.\nIt was a case the government was about to lose.\nThe settlement was approved by a federal judge.\nBecerra\u2019s statement, \u201cit needlessly endangered our children, our loved ones and our men and women in law enforcement,\u201d is preposterous left-wing political argle-bargle.\nI suspect the Washington judge\u2019s stay will be overturned on appeal, but certainly will if it makes it to the Supreme Court.\nThe federal government has no standing to restrict speech in this manner.\n\u2013BL\n\n",

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2018\nThe Washington Post first reported on the story prior to Trump\u2019s tweet.\nTrump and Tillerson have had a fraught relationship for many months.\nTrump told reporters Tuesday that he ultimately decided to fire the secretary because they disagreed over strategy in key areas of foreign policy, such as the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the approach to North Korea and the overall tone of U.S. diplomacy.\nTillerson said he received a call from Trump around noon Tuesday, more than three hours after his firing was first reported by The Washington Post and announced minutes later in a tweet from the president.\nHis voice quivering, Tillerson thanked career diplomats for their \u201chonesty and integrity\u201d and the American people for \u201cacts of kindness,\u201d and he singled out Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for their partnership and mutual support of diplomacy.\nBut he notably did not thank Trump or praise his policies.\nTillerson said he will remain in his post until March 31 but is delegating all authorities for running the State Department to Deputy Secretary John Sullivan and is committed to ensuring \u201can orderly and smooth transition.\u201d The deposed diplomat also made a clear statement about Russian aggression: \u201cMuch work remains to respond to the troubling behavior and actions on the part of the Russian government.\u201d\n\ufeff\nCNBC reports that Tillerson was not the only firing that took place on Tuesday:\nOn Tuesday morning, State Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said Tillerson had no plans to leave.\nHe \u201cdid not speak to the president this morning and is unaware of the reason\u201d for his firing, the spokesman added.\nTwo White House officials told the Associated Press that Tillerson found out he was fired Friday.\nThe secretary got a call from White House chief of staff John Kelly but only got told an unspecified presidential tweet concerning him may be coming, officials at the State Department told the wire service.\nLater, the White House fired Goldstein, who contradicted the administration\u2019s account of Tillerson\u2019s ouster, according to NBC News and the AP.\nGoldstein was the under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs.\nTrump later told reporters he disagreed with Tillerson on some issues and feels the diplomat \u201cwill be much happier now.\u201d\nWhile many are happy that Tillerson is gone, many of us are concerned with Mike Pompeo being installed at Secretary of State, especially regarding his un-American comments against NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, who exposed the criminal activity of the Deep State in DC.\nSpeaking of Snowden, he decided to chime in on the newly appointed CIA director, but did not say anything about Pompeo becoming Secretary of State.\n\u201cThe new CIA director was a key part of the torture program and its illegal cover-up.\nHer name was on the Top Secret order demanding the destruction of tapes to prevent them being seen by Congress.\nIncredible.\u201d Snowden tweeted.\nThe new CIA director was a key part of the torture program and its illegal

https://t.co/Rg6nMJBxch \u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) March 13, 2018\nGlenn Greenwald, author of the above piece at The Intercept wrote, \u201cHaspel, who will be the first woman to lead CIA, didn\u2019t just oversee the Bush CIA\u2019s black site but directly participated in the horrific torture of detainees.\nShe also participated in the particularly gruesome torture of detainee Abu Zubaydah.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a radical departure for CIA,\u201d Greenwald added.\n\u201cAfter all, Haspel did this under George Tenet.\nAt the time, John Brennan \u2013 who became Obama\u2019s CIA director \u2013 was an advocate of rendition & other torture methods.\nAnd Pompeo was fine with black sites.\nStill notable: she\u2019s an actual torturer.\u201d\nFrom Greenwald\u2019s article:\nThis is more of the same old, same old going on, and it looks like it\u2019s about to get a lot worse.\nArticle posted with permission from Sons Of Liberty Media\n\n",

        "target": "Trump Effect: Islamic Republic Ceases Naval Provocations in Arabian Gulf\n\nYesterday\u2019s State of the Union address issued by Donald Trump represented a refreshing break from the eight years of pusillanimous foreign policies pursued by past administration.\nNowhere was this more evident than in the manner in which Trump described Iran\u2019s repressive regime and attempts by the Iranian people to overthrow it through peaceful protest.\nWhen it comes to Iran\u2019s governing authorities, the Trump administration is under no illusions about the nefarious nature of this fascist theocracy.\n\u201cWe are restoring clarity about our adversaries,\u201d Trump stated in a not too subtle jibe at his predecessor who seemed to be in a perpetual state of confusion about who his friends and enemies were.\nTrump also referenced the recent widespread Iranian protests, crushed with extreme ruthlessness by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Basij auxiliary militia.\n\u201cWhen the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of a corrupt dictatorship,\u201d he stated, \u201cI did not stay silent.\nAmerica stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.\u201d\nBy contrast, Barack Obama and his obsequious acolytes were besotted by the prospect of forging d\u00e9tente with the despotic mullahs of the Islamic Republic.\nHis administration remained largely silent when Iranians took to the streets in 2009 to protest a rigged election.\nSome have speculated that his administration missed out on a prime opportunity for regime change.\nIt was only downhill from there.\nIn a misguided effort to secure Iran\u2019s willingness to sign the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Obama sold everything including the kitchen sink.\nHe tried selling the American people on the na\u00efve notion that there were moderate elements of import in the Iranian government, ignoring the obvious fact that all authority in Iran is vested with the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and his IRGC henchmen.\nThe tried and true concept of peace through strength gave way to fecklessness through appeasement.\nRansom payments to the tune of $1.7 billion were transferred to Iran.\nPromising criminal investigations targeting Iran\u2019s chief terror proxy, Hezbollah, were shut down.\nTargeted liquidation operations by our Israeli allies against Iranian Quds Force leaders were foiled after Obama tipped off Tehran on Israel\u2019s intentions.\nIranian material breaches of the JCPOA were all but ignored while Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program was allowed to proceed at full speed despite being in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolution 2231.\nObama\u2019s near messianic zealotry in his interactions with the mullahs severely compromised America\u2019s national security and weakened its image on the international stage.\nWorse, it emboldened the mullahs (appeasement tends to do that) who seemed to revel in Obama\u2019s groveling.\nIran\u2019s mischief-making extends far and wide but it is in the Arabian Gulf where friction between the IRGC and the United States Navy remains constant.\nIran regards the Arabian Gulf as its domain and but for the presence of the U.S. 5th Fleet, would have full reign over its waters, which include the strategic Strait of Hormuz.\nIn addition to securing the Gulf, the 5th Fleet serves as a constant reminder to the Iranians of their impotence.\nBut the deterrent effect of the Navy\u2019s 5th Fleet, and for that matter America\u2019s military might, is only as effective as the political leadership that commands it, and Barack Obama as Commander in Chief of the armed forces did little to instill fear or project deterrence.\nOn the contrary, the Iranians correctly viewed him as weak, indecisive and ineffectual.\nOn his watch, American warships patrolling the Gulf were harried by armed IRGC speed boats and larger navy frigates with near impunity.\nAt times Iranian naval vessels closed to within 600 to 150 yards of American warships.\nThe navy termed these near ritualistic, belligerent encounters, \u201cunsafe and unprofessional.\u201d\nIranian arrogance and impudence reached its zenith with the January 12th 2016 seizure of two American riverine command boats and their crews near Farsi Island.\nThe RCBs and crews manning them were returned some 16 hours later but not before the Iranians stole two satellite phone sim cards, likely containing classified information, as well as thousands of pages of information downloaded from laptops, GPS devices and maps used by the sailors.\nIronically, the seizure occurred on the very day that Obama was to give his State of the Union address but predictably, he didn\u2019t think that the seizure of Americans was important enough to note.\nBut according to the Navy, the past five months have witnessed markedly less belligerent conduct from the Iranians, leaving Navy officials baffled by the sudden positive change in attitude.\nIn fact, Iran\u2019s attitude adjustment in the Arabian Gulf is no mystery and stems from the Trump administration\u2019s implementation of a new robust foreign policy vis-\u00e0-vis the Islamic Republic.\nSoon after taking office, Trump noted that \u201cIran [was] playing with fire\u201d and added that he wouldn\u2019t be as \u201ckind\u201d to the mullahs as Obama was.\nThis wasn\u2019t empty rhetoric.\nIt was backed up by tangible action.\nAdditional sanctions were imposed against Iran for acting in defiance of UNSCR 2231.\nSanctions were also imposed against the IRGC for supporting terrorism.\nTrump\u2019s DOJ revived and breathed new life into Project Cassandra, a promising anti-Hezbollah/IRGC law enforcement initiative shelved by Obama.\nMost importantly, Trump failed to certify the JCPOA noting material Iranian breaches, and has threatened to abrogate the deal in its entirety unless modifications are implemented.\nThose modifications would include an end to absurd sunset clauses in the JCPOA and tough restrictions on ballistic missile testing.\nThe mullahs have become cognizant of the fact that there\u2019s a new sheriff in town, one that backs up tough talk with action and doesn\u2019t ask \u201chow high\u201d when they say \u201cjump.\u201d Clearly, the IRGC\u2019s new docile posture in the Arabian Gulf is a direct consequence of this realization.\n\n",
