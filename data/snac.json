Not only such men as Caesar add are dangerous, but also having little enjoyment within themselves, they can never become agreeable to others or contribute to social entertainment. The utility of courage to the public and to the person possessed of it is an obvious foundation of merit. The philosophical tranquillity may be considered only as a branch of magnanimity. If the foregoing hypothesis is accepted, it will be easy to determine the question of general morals. Though we postponed the decision of that question, lest it should involve us in intricate speculations, we may resume it now and examine how far either reason or sentiment enters into all decisions of praise or censure.",
