        "source": "In the 1937 Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Queen was originally to be named Queen Grimhilde, but she is never actually named in the film. However, in the 1937\u20131938 film tie-in serial comic strip Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs written by Merrill De Maris, one of the writers of the Disney film, the Queen is actually named Queen Grimhilde. Additionally, in Walt Disney's 1937 animated feature film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Evil Queen is known as the Wicked Queen or just the Queen. This character is based on the Evil Queen character from the 1812 German fairy tale Snow White by the Brothers Grimm. However, in the film, Walt Disney changed the Queen from Snow White's biological mother to Snow White's stepmother. ",

        "source": "Although the chronological limits of this period are open to debate, the period of Enlightenment in Europe is said to have lasted between the 17th and 18th centuries. The period of time before that is described as the middle ages. The Petrine Era (Russia, 1689\u20131725) would fall under this time period. ",

Pemberton.\n\n### Question: Who came up with the saying the customer is always right?",

C. Schmidt and O. Knoblauch.\n\n### Passage Title: Photoelectric effect\nAbove the threshold frequency, the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectron depends on the frequency of the incident light, but is independent of the intensity of the incident light so long as the latter is not too high.\nFor a given metal and frequency of incident radiation, the rate at which photoelectrons are ejected is directly proportional to the intensity of the incident light.\nAn increase in the intensity of the incident beam (keeping the frequency fixed) increases the magnitude of the photoelectric current, although the stopping voltage remains the same.\nThe time lag between the incidence of radiation and the emission of a photoelectron is very small, less than 10 second.\nThe direction of distribution of emitted electrons peaks in the direction of polarization (the direction of the electric field) of the incident light, if it is linearly polarized.\nIn 1905, Einstein proposed an explanation of the photoelectric effect using a concept first put forward by Max Planck that light waves consist of tiny bundles or packets of energy known as photons or quanta.\nThe maximum kinetic energy formula_1 of an ejected electron is given by\n\nwhere formula_3 is the Planck constant and formula_4 is the frequency of the incident photon.\n\n### Passage Title: Photoelectric effect\nTo make sense of the fact that light can eject electrons even if its intensity is low, Albert Einstein proposed that a beam of light is not a wave propagating through space, but rather a collection of discrete wave packets (photons), each with energy \"h\u03bd\".\nThis shed light on Max Planck's previous discovery of the Planck relation () linking energy (\"E\") and frequency (\"\u03bd\") as arising from quantization of energy.\nThe factor \"h\" is known as the Planck constant.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily.\nIn 1900, while studying black-body radiation, the German physicist Max Planck suggested that the energy carried by electromagnetic waves could only be released in \"packets\" of energy.\nIn 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper advancing the hypothesis that light energy is carried in discrete quantized packets to explain experimental data from the photoelectric effect.\nThis model contributed to the development of quantum mechanics.\nIn 1914, Millikan's Experiment supported Einstein's model of the photoelectric effect.\nEinstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", and Robert Millikan was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1923 for \"his work on the elementary charge of electricity and on the photoelectric effect\".\n\n### Question: Who developed an explanation for the photoelectric effect?",
        "source": "Before Albert Einstein's discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect in 1905, a number of scientists had discovered and developed an explanation for the photoelectric effect. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz and Wilhelm Hallwachs discovered that light, and especially ultra-violet light, discharges negatively electrified bodies with the production of rays of the same nature as cathode rays. Between 1888 and 1891, Aleksandr Stoletov invented a new experimental setup which was more suitable for a quantitative analysis of the photo effect. In 1900, while studying black-body radiation, the German physicist Max Planck suggested that the energy carried by electromagnetic waves could only be released in packets of energy.",

        "source": "Astral microtubules are a subclass of microtubules and develop in the actin skeleton. They interact with the cell cortex to aid in spindle orientation. Microtubules form part of the cytoskeleton and provide structure and shape to eukaryotic cells. ",

        "source": "The oldest mini golf course, that was first mentioned in The Illustrated London News, is in Gofstacle, London but in Hamburg, Germany is where the oldest documented mini golf course in Europe is located. Thistle Dhu in Pinehurst, North Carolina has the oldest standardized mini golf course and the Maples Inn in Pointe-Claire, Quebec is Canada\u2019s oldest. ",

Bush.\nThese principles include unilateralism and the use of preventative war.\nCharles Krauthammer first used the phrase in June 2001 to describe the Bush Administration's \"...unilaterally withdrawing from the ABM treaty and rejecting the Kyoto protocol.\"\nAfter the 9/11 attack, the phrase described the policy that the United States had the right to secure itself against countries that harbor or give aid to terrorist groups, which was used to justify the 2001 war in Afghanistan.\nThe Bush Doctrine became strongly associated with the Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq in 2003.\nDifferent pundits have attributed different meanings to the Bush Doctrine.\nIt was used to describe specific policy elements, including a strategy of \"preemptive strikes\" as a defense against an immediate or perceived future threat to the security of the United States.\nThis policy principle was applied particularly in the Middle East to counter international terrorist organizations and to justify the invasion of Iraq.\nGenerally, the Bush Doctrine was used to indicate a willingness to unilaterally pursue U.S. military interests.\nSome of these policies were codified in a National Security Council text entitled the \"National Security Strategy of the United States\" published on September 20, 2002.\n\n### Question: What idea was used to justify u.s. foreign policy during the cold war era?",
        "source": "The Bush Doctrine, the multiple interrelated foreign policy principles of the 43rd President of the United States, George W. Bush, was very different from the Truman Doctrine. The Truman Doctrine was based on the ideas of deterrence and containment during the Cold War. Bush gave several speeches that the US should actively support democratic governments around the world, especially in the Middle East.",
        "target": "The Cold War idea of deterrence and containment, which was used to justify u.s. foreign policy during the Cold War era, was displaced by the idea that the United States had the right to secure itself against countries that harbor or give aid to terrorist groups, which was used to justify the 2001 war in Afghanistan. The Bush Doctrine refers to various related foreign policy principles of the 43rd President of the United States, George W. Bush.
