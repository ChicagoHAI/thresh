# Annotation Tool Builder

### Set up
- Clone repo into local directory, then `cd nlproc.tools`
- Set up Vue: `npm install`
- To run a dev environment: `npm run dev`
- When you're done making changes: `npm run build`
- If you want to run a linter on your code: `npm run lint`
- If you want to deploy to GitHub pages: `npm run deploy`. This creates a `gh-pages` branch. You will need to go into GitHub Pages settings and set the source branch to `gh-pages`.
