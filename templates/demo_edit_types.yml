# We will show the different options and edit types we support. Our goal is to support
# any subset of features, such as error selection on only outputs, or edit selection on
# text-to-text generation tasks.

edits:
  - name: edit_with_annotation
    label: "Custom Annotation"
    enable_input: true

    # We currently support any HEX color or the following color keywords:
    # red, orange, yellow, green, teal, blue
    color: "#a468c4"

    # We use the open-source Font Awesome to declare icons
    # For an icon search, see: http://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&m=free
    icon: fa-pen

    # Each edit has a corresponding annotation, but we will focus on this aspect
    # in the next tutorial:
    annotation:
      - name: edit_quality
        label: "Edit Quality"
        question: "What's the quality of this edit?"
        options: likert-3

  # Multi-selection edits allow selecting multiple text spans. This is useful if your edit
  # may not be a continuous set of words (such as an error in a summarization relating to
  # multiple antecedents in a context article)

  # Up until now we've only looked at one "type" of edit: primitive edits. These are edits
  # that are directly selected on a sentence. Composite edits are formed by selecting multiple
  # primitive edits. 
  - name: composite

    type: composite

  # Our last edit selects manually identified breakpoints in a sentence. This is useful for
