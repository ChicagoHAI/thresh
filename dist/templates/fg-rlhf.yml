template_description: Fine-grained human feedback typology introduced by Wu et al., 2023 for RLHF

# ========================================================================================
#
# This typology is used as part of a RLHF pipeline for fine-tuning a LLM as a  QA system.
# The original interface had annotators select missing info at the bottom of the interface
# instead of selecting the relevant span in the passage. See Figures 5 & 6 in App. C of 
# Wu et al., 2023 for details.
