template_description: Morphological generation error inspection performed by Gorman et al., 2019

# ========================================================================================
#
# Gorman et al., 2019 perform a manual error analysis of the CoNLLâ€“SIGMORPHON 2017 Shared Task
# on Morphological Reinflection. Their analysis is on the top 2 systems from the task across
# 12 languages. We show their English typology, although any of their 12 typologies could be adapted.
