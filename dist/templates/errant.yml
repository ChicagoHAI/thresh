template_description: Grammatical Error Type Classification

# ========================================================================================
#
# Unlike other interfaces, ERRANT is a rule-based GEC framework, not an inspection / evalu-
# ation typology. This interface is helpful for GEC inspection.
#
# See Appendix A of Bryant et al., 2017 for full breakdown of 55 error types. To adapt their 
# typology to an interface, we first select the "Operation Tier", then the "Token"/"Morphology"
# tier, then the fine-grained type.
