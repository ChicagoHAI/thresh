        "target": "Begin by loosening the lug nuts, lifting the vehicle with a jack, removing the lug nuts and the flat tire, and then placing the spare tire onto the wheel studs, tightening the lug nuts in a star pattern, and lowering the vehicle back down. Finally, securely tighten the lug nuts with a lug wrench, double-checking the tightness, and ensure that the spare tire is properly inflated before driving."
