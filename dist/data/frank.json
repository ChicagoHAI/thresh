Adversity sometimes brings out the best in people, although nerves did seem to take effect after half-time.Foran has said for some time his side just needed one win to get going. They have it and look capable of more as the pressure turns, at least temporarily, to sides above.Tansey, who has agreed a pre-contract to join Aberdeen, was at the heart of the Saturday lunchtime victory. It was his delivery that found McKay ghosting in and the defender's finish was perfect.Another Tansey delivery was rewarded when Donati wrestled Draper to the ground. Tansey took the responsibility and delivered under pressure.In truth, Inverness could have been out of sight by the break.Billy Mckay should have done better from close range twice and Alex Fisher somehow screwed a header wide from a few yards after Remi Matthews had parried Tansey's drive.And, in the second period, Scott Boden could have sealed the win when clean through but dinked over.Martin Canning's side improved significantly after the break as Crawford and Redmond were sent on in place of Donati and Rakish Bingham.And Crawford thought he had earned a lifeline. As Gary Warren tried to shepherd the ball out, Esson came flying out and inexplicably took the substitute down.Referee Andrew Dallas did not point to the spot, leaving Hamilton players in disbelief. It was a huge escape for the home side.Having offered little earlier in the match, other than a great chance for Darian MacKinnon which he prodded wide, the second-half response was firm.Dougie Imrie, Crawford and Greg Docherty all came close but ultimately they did not threaten enough and gave themselves too much to do after leaving themselves repeatedly exposed in defence.Redmond's late finish was little consolation, although the goal may yet have an important part to play in the final make-up of goal difference with so few points separating the sides.Match ends, Inverness CT 2, Hamilton Academical 1.Second Half ends, Inverness CT 2, Hamilton Academical 1.Goal!

        "context": "David Cameron this afternoon hit back at growing criticism over his election campaign \u2013 vowing to carry on warning about Labour's threat to the economy. The Prime Minister this morning faced the first serious criticism of the campaign so far, as Tory donors rounded on the party's lacklustre message and failure to pull away in the polls. But a defiant Mr Cameron this afternoon pledged to continue focussing on bread-and-butter issues like jobs, business and childcare. Scroll down for video David Cameron this afternoon hit back at growing criticism over his election campaign \u2013 vowing to carry on warning about Labour's threat to the economy He told supporters in Somerset: 'If you want political excitement. Go to Greece. If you want more showbiz in this election. Go to Hollywood. 'But here and now in the UK I'm focused on something real \u2013 a stronger economy.' Mr Cameron insisted the economy 'excites' millions of people. He said he would campaign on 'more jobs, more homes, more business, more childcare, more security in retirement'. He said: 'I make no apologies for focusing hard on that which is central to everything. When you get a new job, a new home, get a new childcare place or start a new business\u2026 now that's truly exiting. 'And you only get these things with a strong and stable government - not one held to ransom. That's not the excitement 'Britain needs. That's not a risk Britain should take.' Mr Cameron's remarks comes amid claims senior Tory figures are already planning to make Boris Johnson the next leader. Some MPs are prepared to engineer a coup against Mr Cameron in the days after May 7 by submitting letters of no-confidence in him and planning a 'mass show of support' for the London Mayor if the Tories lose, the Sunday Times reported. One major donor, who declined to be named, told the newspaper: 'Boris is the only one who can win. Everyone knows what is going to happen in 10 days' time. If Dave doesn't make it we'll get rid of him.' The Tories have nudged ahead in the polls with less than two weeks to go until polling day, but Tories are increasingly concerned it may be too little too late London Mayor Boris Johnson - appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr show this morning, has distanced himself from claims that he is being lined up to replace David Cameron as Tory leader Multimillionaire Tory donor Peter Hall, who has given almost \u00a3600,000 to the Tory party since 2005, meanwhile has criticised Mr Cameron's 'curious lack of energy and belief in his campaign.' He said the PM needs to raise his game and 'unleash visceral passion and belief in his vision of the future', 'get down and dirty', as well as showing 'he cares', if he is to win on May 7. 'If we don't have a Conservative government after May 7 it will be because of David Cameron. His decision not to keep those Ukip people in the Tory tribe was a key error. 'I see no powerful vision of the future provided by David Cameron. There is no clear considered view of where we are headed.' Mr Hall warned that Cameron's mantra as a sound steward of the economy 'is not enough to win the votes needed to win the election' and added: 'Some people are really quite resigned to losing and they are planning the next step. 'It's a horrifying prospect if we were to lose. How can we lose when so much is at stake and when we have such a strong hand?'",

        "context": "Mike Tindall wouldn't have moved any quicker had he been surging towards the posts in a Six Nations clash at Twickenham. In Aintree's crowded unsaddling area, the former England captain was making a beeline to the place marked with a big number '3', with his wife, Zara Phillips, scampering in hot pursuit. Not even a hug from AP McCoy could check his momentum. No wonder. Tindall was beaming from ear-to-ear having just seen Monbeg Dude, the horse whom he owns with James Simpson-Daniel and Nicky Robinson, run his heart out and wanted to be in place for when the old warrior, who was sent off unconsidered at 40/1, returned. Former England rugby captain Mike Tindall and wife Zara Philipps at Aintree ahead of the Grand National Tindall celebrates after watching his horse\u00a0Monbeg Dude finish third in the National Monbeg Dude is now 10 and, according to his jockey Liam Treadwell, 'likes to do things at his own pace' but his resolution is not in question and this was the latest wonderful day he had given his owners and trainer Michael Scudamore. Think about this for a CV: a Welsh Grand National in January 2013, victory in a big chase at Cheltenham in December of the same year and being placed in a Hennessey Gold Cup at Newbury last November, then this. Not bad for a horse that cost \u00a312,000. While the exultant connections of winner Many Clouds were celebrating a few yards away, their joy was almost matched by the happiness of the Monbeg Dude team; as Michael shook his head in wonder, his father Peter, the former champion jump jockey, dashed to engulf him in a bear hug. Here was thumping evidence that no other race stirs the emotions quite like the Crabbie's Grand National. The \u00a388,400 was by far the biggest pot Monbeg Dude has collected in his 24-race career but the reactions of Tindal et al (ITALICISE) showed this was about far more than money. 'Pride is the word I would use,' said Michael Scudamore. 'I am so happy for the horse. He is unbelievably tough and brave. To put in a performance like that after coming here last year (finishing seventh), I am just so proud. The owners are buzzing, so is the jockey.' Many Clouds and Aspell jump a fence on the way to winning the 2015 Grand National at Aintree Treadwell's contented look as he strolled to the Owners and Trainers tent a little while after said as much. He won the Grand National in 2009, when steering Mon Mome to a 100/1 success, but this was the first time he had ridden in the race since 2010, when unseating at the 20th from Nozic. 'I am absolutely delighted,' said Treadwell. 'The horse didn't even know he had been in a race. He got hampered at Becher's Brook the first time and that checked his momentum but he has given me a fantastic ride. 'Last year he looked like he was going to be the winner going to the last and there was a point when I thought my run was going to take me there this time but he just flattened out a bit at The Elbow. But what a great day. I really appreciate everything about this atmosphere now.' He wasn't the only one. Aintree, even when you are defeated, is a place where dreams can come true.",

Syria is in war, and the Americans and others have to take this into consideration.\"He described as \"absolutely unacceptable\" US Secretary of State John Kerry's recent condemnation of the government's use of barrel bombs in the city of Aleppo.The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claims 246 people, including 73 children, have been killed in Aleppo in the last five days alone after barrels containing explosives and metal fragments were dropped by military helicopters.Activist group The Aleppo Media Centre claims 14 people were killed in barrel bomb attacks on the Masaken Hanano district on Thursday, citing footage appearing to show bombs being dropped from a helicopter onto a civilian area.\"We are defending our people against terrorist attacks. We have never bombarded places with civilians,\" Mr Mekdad insisted, accusing the US of \"still supporting terrorist elements\" in the country.The Syrian government, via state media, also denied reports that rebels had seized most of Aleppo's central prison.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said members of the Islamic Front coalition, dominated by the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the al-Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front, mounted the assault, freeing hundreds of detainees.But state television insisted soldiers and security forces had \"thwarted an attack against the prison by terrorist groups\".The Observatory says fighting is still going on, but the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the Aleppo Media Centre, a citizen-journalist outlet, say rebels now completely control the prison.It is reported to hold at least 3,000 detainees, including Islamists, activists and minors, in horrific conditions.Syria has about 1,300 tonnes of declared chemical weapons.The US said last week that so far only about 4% of the stockpile - 30 tonnes - had left the country.US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said he was \"concerned\" that the UN-backed plan was falling behind schedule and said Damascus \"had to take responsibility for fulfilling its commitment\".Russia - a key ally of Syria - has said Damascus should complete the transfer of its chemical weapons to the coast for removal by ship by 1 March.A deadline was set last year for all the weapons to be destroyed by the end of June.The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which is overseeing the destruction operation, has admitted the process has been slowed down by security concerns.Mr Mekdad stressed: \"Syria is committed to all its agreements, with the OPCW and the UN Security Council.

        "context": "Media playback is not supported on this deviceA World Anti-Doping Agency commission report has accused Russia of running a \"state-sponsored\" doping programme.And Warner said he feels sports other than athletics have reason to be concerned at how Russian sport is run.\"This iceberg spreads in two different directions,\" he said. \"I suspect there are probably four, five or six nations that athletics has a problem with.\"Commission chairman Dick Pound said Russia's athletics federation, Araf, should be banned from the Rio 2016 Olympics.Warner told BBC Radio 5 live: \"Every other international sport today should be looking at Russian sport and looking at whether the men and women who compete in their events are clean.\"\"They do not have robust anti-doping regimes. They are asleep on the job - and they have to be rooted out.\"Wada's independent commission, which examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in Russian athletics, also implicated the International Association of Athletics' Federations.The IAAF's former president Lamine Diack has been provisionally suspended by the International Olympic Committee, who have also asked the IAAF to start disciplinary action against the athletes named in the report.Araf has been told to respond to the report by Friday and Russia have defended their position.Acting head of Russia Athletics Federation, Vadim Zelichenok, said: \"There is an element of a political hit job here because quite a few things were described in the report in a biased way.\"Russia's sports ministry has said it will work more closely with Wada,Igor Zagorskiy, deputy director of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency, Rusada, told the BBC: \"There is always room for improvement.\"We are on that track and we've been on that track together with Wada. We will continue this work on this.\"Warner says the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), must be restructured to combat the problem.He revealed that he had spoken to IAAF president Lord Coe since Monday's publication of Wada's independent commission, which examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in Russian athletics, and also implicated the IAAF.The 323-page report said that \"acceptance of cheating at all levels is widespread\" in Russia and suggested that neither Araf, Rusada, nor the Russian Federation can be considered anti-doping code-compliant.The report also said the London 2012 Olympics were \"sabotaged\" by \"widespread inaction\" against athletes with suspicious doping profiles; accuses Moscow laboratory director Grigory Rodchenko of asking for and accepting bribes and intentionally destroying samples he was told to keep; and recommends that five Russian athletes and five coaches should be given lifetime doping bans.Media playback is not supported on this devicePound, who chaired the Wada investigation, said the situation was \"worse than we thought\", adding that \"it may be a residue of the old Soviet Union system\".Warner backed the recommendation to suspend Russia from competition \"until they put their house in order\", adding: \"If you punish one or two innocent Russian athletes for the greater good of the sport, that is a moral dilemma I am willing to grasp.\"He also suggested that Russia is unlikely to be the only country guilty of doping, saying that \"athletics has probably got some other nations to root out\".He added that while \"there are undoubtedly drugs cheats in many corners of athletics\", he believed systemic doping did not occur in nations in the Western world.During a special BBC Radio 5 live programme examining the independent report, Britain's marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe said: \"I don't think anyone is under the impression it's only Russia.\"On the same programme, former British sprinter Darren Campbell warned of \"darker days to come\".He said: \"This report was about Russia, and they need to be punished if this holds up, but we'll lose sight on the bigger issues if we focus on Russia. It's about cleaning everything out.\"There's people talking about testing out in Kenya and Jamaica. We can't have rumours anymore.\"We need to understand how the Russians got away with it. How did this happen yet nobody knew?\"No matter how dark and depressing it gets, change has to happen now.\"Coe, elected IAAF president in August, described the Wada report as \"alarming\" and has said he will seek urgent approval from members to consider sanctions against the Russian federation.The report found evidence of multiple rules breaches by IAAF officials and found the governing body to be \"inexplicably lax in following up suspicious blood (and other) profiles\".Media playback is not supported on this deviceIt has also been criticised for its handling of the allegations, with Coe himself describing claims about suspicious blood profiles involving some athletes as \"a declaration of war on my sport\" in August.On Monday, Coe said that \"if there are failings in our governance or our anti-doping programme I will fix them\".But Warner says Coe needs to restructure the IAAF in order for it to effectively tackle the problem.\"This cannot be a one-man crusade,\" Warner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"He needs to ensure there is a bench around him at the IAAF who dramatically improve the operation.\"We all know, and he has already said, he needs to go out and hire a good chief executive.\"It needs more than that. He also possibly needs a chairman under him so he can take the lead of the elected council and be the ambassador for the sport and have full-time professional staff, possibly from outside sport, from elsewhere in business, who can get a grip on the organisation.\"",

The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry.Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach.My recent exhibition, titled \"Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell\", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry.I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000.AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two.The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands.This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement.It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today.Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.",

Some are fighting for promotion and some relegation, but this Saturday could see a number of ups and downs in English football. Here, Sportsmail's guide takes you through the permutations in the Championship, League One, League Two and the Conference. Watford can be promoted if they win and one of Bournemouth or Middlesbrough lose and Norwich fail to win Rotherham's desire to stave off relegation to League One has been made more difficult by a points deduction Steve McClaren will be desperate to manage in the Premier League again; Derby can secure a play-off spot Championship Watford (away to Brighton) will be promoted if they win and one of Bournemouth (home to Bolton, Monday) or Middlesbrough (away to Fulham) lose and Norwich (away to Rotherham) fail to win. Derby (away to Millwall) will make sure of a play-off place if they win. Ipswich (home to Nottingham Forest) will make sure of a play-off place if they win and both Brentford (away to Reading) and Wolves (away to Wigan) fail to win. The situation at the bottom is complicated by Rotherham's three-point deduction for fielding an ineligible player. If Rotherham win,\u00a0Wigan will be relegated if they fail to win. If Rotherham win, Millwall will be relegated if they lose. League One Preston (home to Swindon) will be promoted if they win and MK Dons (away to Rochdale) lose. Sheffield United (away to Leyton Orient) and Chesterfield (home to Bristol City) will be guaranteed play-off places with wins or if Rochdale fail to win. Leyton Orient (home to Sheff Utd) and Notts County (home to Doncaster) will be relegated if they lose and Crewe (away to Coventry) win and Crawley (away to Peterborough) avoid defeat. Colchester (away to Fleetwood) will be relegated if they lose and Crewe and Crawley win and Port Vale (away to Yeovil) avoid defeat. Jermaine Beckford (left) and Daniel Johnson celebrate; Preston can be promoted if they win and MK Dons lose Burton Albion have already been promoted but they can secure champion status this weekend League Two Already-promoted Burton (home to Northampton) will be champions if they win and Shrewsbury (away to Cheltenham) fail to win.

Stevenage (home to Carlisle) will guarantee a play-off place if they win or if one of Plymouth (home to Tranmere) or Luton fails to win. Tranmere will be relegated if they lose and if one of Hartlepool (home to Exeter) or Cheltenham win. Tranmere will also be relegated if they fail to win and Hartlepool win. Cheltenham will be relegated if they lose and Hartlepool win. ........................................................................... Conference Barnet (home to Gateshead) will be promoted as champions if they win. Bristol Rovers (home to Alfreton) will be promoted as champions if they win and Barnet fail to win. Eastleigh (home to Kidderminster) and Forest Green (home to Dover) will guarantee play-off places if they win or if Macclesfield (away to Torquay) fail to win. Macclesfield need to win and hope either Eastleigh lose or Forest Green fail to win. Barring a 14-goal swing, Alfreton will be relegated if they lose. Welling (home to Southport) will be relegated if they lose and Alfreton draw or if they draw and Alfreton win. Southport will be relegated if they lose and Alfreton win by reversing an eight-goal goal-difference deficit.

The breakdown in the relationship between the FA and England Supporters Travel Club led to the offensive chants during England\u2019s 1-1 draw with Italy in Turin on Tuesday. The tasteless repertoire of songs ran from \u2018F*** the IRA\u2019, to \u2018F*** the Taliban\u2019 to \u2018F*** the English FA\u2019 \u2014 the last one due to the huge discontent over the decision to switch double loyalty caps from away trips to home games at Wembley. Those with most caps get priority when buying tickets for big games. The Football Supporters Federation, despite putting out a statement yesterday reaffirming its opposition to abusive chanting, believe it is inevitable that the songs \u2014 and the World War Two favourites \u2014 will be sung when England play the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on June 7. There were offensive chants made by England fans during the game against Italy in Turin on Tuesday - there is no suggestion the fans pictured were involved England's next international is against Ireland and takes place in Dublin on June 7 The FSF are in no mood to work with the FA because of the caps dispute and claim that, having taken legal advice, anti-IRA and WW2 songs are not law-breaking and that the FA showed no interest when the FSF first tackled England fans singing offensive songs in 2005. The FA regard loyalty caps and abusive chanting as two separate issues. Staging Rugby World Cup games at Leicester City\u2019s King Power Stadium rather than the sport\u2019s Welford Road stronghold continues to be a problem for organisers. The loyal Leicester rugby public want little to do with their football neighbours, whose three group fixtures are a long way from being sold out. Radio 5 Live\u2019s loveable football commentator Alan Green was not happy at being asked to pay city tax on checking out of Turin\u2019s Hotel Carlina after the England game. Green was overheard at reception moaning it was BBC\u2019s responsibility to settle the bill and not his. But Green eventually had to cough up\u2026all of seven euros.

Jak I am the proudest Mummy ever xxxxx Simply the best xxx.\"The West Calder High School pupil had been documenting his life and treatment on social media.Since he was diagnosed with cancer last August, Jak had been posting updates on a Facebook page called Jak's Journey with the help of his mother, sister Aimie and girlfriend Hannah Boyd.The teenager's story of his fight against cancer, and his relentlessly positive attitude, touched the hearts of many people in West Lothian and beyond.The Jak's Journey page attracted more than 28,000 Likes and documented the teenage goalkeeper's love of Rangers FC, and his meetings with former Ibrox stars Neil Alexander and Nacho Novo and current goalkeeper Cammy Bell.On Saturday, he managed to make it along to his prom for 10 minutes but had to leave as he felt unwell.Jak was greeted at the event by former Rangers captain Barry Ferguson.The teenager wrote on his page: \"I would just like to make a massive apology for me only turning up and then having to go again.\"I was gutted and really sad as I never spoke to anyone, but I took really unwell really quickly as I had been lying in bed for three days without hardly moving.\"Thank you to everyone who organised it and came along. Even just knowing it was all happening for me makes me smile.\"At the party, Jak's family collected the teenager's Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award and also the Kerry MacGregor Memorial Trophy for overcoming adversity.The Jak's Journey website highlighted Jak's stay at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh and Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow over the past few months.He was visited by players from Celtic, Hibs, Hearts and Edinburgh Rugby and the cast of the musical Wicked.Jak and his family also published many other personal moments, including him playing his tuba and visiting his classmates and teachers at school.On 23 January, Jak and his family found out from doctors that his cancer had spread throughout his body. The medics made a decision to not pursue any other treatment.At the time, Jak wrote: \"This is the saddest day of our lives yet but I am going to fight the pain and get as many days/weeks/months/years I can get.

Sinfield was on the losing side on his debut for the Rhinos against Sheffield Eagles at Headingley in 1997 and he was powerless to prevent a repeat on his landmark occasion, with the Wolves running out 29-10 winners. The Rhinos were already trailing 20-4 when the former England skipper entered the action five minutes into the second half and it did not get much better as the Yorkshiremen came up with their worst performance of the season in front of a 17,430 crowd. Warrington Wolves forward\u00a0Roy Asotasi crosses for one of his side's five tries on the night Warrington had produced their best display in an 18-6 win over Leeds in March and they were again outstanding, with full-back Stefan Ratchford and second rower Ben Currie the pick of an impressive bunch. Leeds had an early chance when prop Adam Cuthbertson was held up over the line but then it was virtually all Warrington as they established a stranglehold on the game. Loose forward Ben Harrison was held up on his back before his back-row partner Currie produced a measured grubber kick on the last tackle to create a try for winger Gene Ormsby. Leeds Rhinos winger Kallum Watkins does brilliantly to touch down in the corner It was then Harrison's turn to demonstrate his kicking skills to get his captain Joel Monaghan in for a second try, although there was a strong hint of a forward pass in the build-up. With scrum-half Richie Myler causing all sorts of problems for the Rhinos defence with his penetrative running, the visitors were good value for their 8-0 lead and it got even better for them on 23 minutes when prop Ashton Sims took hooker Mick Higham's pass near the line to go through a gaping hole for a third try. Ratchford was off target with his first two attempts at goal but it was third time lucky as he made it 14-0 and a Higham 40-20 kick enabled Warrington to maintain the momentum. Warrington forward Ben Harrison is tackled by Stevie Ward during a frantic contest at Headingley Sinfield stayed on the bench throughout the first half but the introduction of forward Mitch Achurch helped perk up the Rhinos in the last 10 minutes and they pulled a try back in scintillating fashion when winger Kallum Watkins finished off a flowing move at the corner. The Leeds captain entered the action five minutes into the second half but his side were trailing 20-4 by then after a break by lively substitute Daryl Clark created the position for Ratchford to get Currie over for Warrington's fourth try. And there was no way back for Sinfield's men when Ormsby's neat offload enabled substitute prop Roy Asotasi to score his first try for more than 12 months. Leeds Rhinos veteran Kevin Sinfield made his 500th appearance for the club on Friday night Ratchford kicked his third goal to stretch his side's lead to 26-4 and increased it with a penalty on 63 minutes after Jamie Peacock was pulled up for a high tackle. The home side pulled a try back five minutes later through Achurch and Sinfield kicked the goal but it was little more than consolation and the Wolves had the final say when stand-off Declan Patton slotted a drop goal to open his account for the club on his third appearance.",

'This is without doubt the biggest game of the season for Villa and possibly one of the biggest in a number of years. 'This is the biggest (of my managerial career).' But the boss believes he must instil a different mentality into his players as he tries to keep them in the top flight. 'We've got different types of players, you look through QPR's side and they've got a lot of players who are men - with a lot of experience in there,' he said. 'We've got a few men in there - but we've got a lot of pretty much icing-on-the-cake players and I'm trying to get that mentality into them to forget about digging out results. It's not what we're cut out to do. 'I haven't identified many players who can't cope with the pressure, but you don't know until they get out there.' Sherwood is without Alan Hutton, Ashley Westwood and Scott Sinclair while Tom Cleverley, Kieran Richardson and Aly Cissokho are doubts. Sherwood faces his friend and former Tottenham assistant, QPR boss Chris Ramsey, for the first time since they both left Spurs last summer. Sherwood and Ramsey forged their friendship at Tottenham and remain close ahead of their showdown The bond between the two remains strong even if Sherwood is blocking Ramsey's mobile phone calls for now Sherwood hinted that if Ramsey's tenure at Loftus Road ends, then he would ask to bring him to Villa Park Ramsey has admitted his job at Rangers could be under threat if they get relegated and, while he admitted Ramsey may prefer to be a manager, Sherwood left the door open for a reunion at Villa. He added: 'If there was ever an opportunity for me to work with him again I would do that. 'I would have to speak to the club about whether we could find a role for him here. 'Listen, I know I am biased - he has been good for me and I have been good for him. But he is up there with the very best coaches I have ever seen.'

        "context": "It's well known that exercise can make your muscles bigger. Now, a study has found it may make your brain larger, too. Physical activity can increase grey matter in the brain, increasing the size of areas that contribute to balance and coordination, according to\u00a0Health Day news. The changes in the brain may have health implications in the long-term, such as reducing the risk of falling, said the study's author, Dr Urho Kujala, of the University of Jyvaskyla. Scroll down for video Exercise can increase the size of areas of the brain that contribute to balance and coordination, a study found It could also reduce the risk of being immobile in older age, he added. Dr Kujala said physical activity has already been linked to a number of health benefits, such as lower levels of body fat, reduced heart disease risk factors, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. But he and his team wanted to understand how exercise affects the brain. They recruited 10 pairs of identical twins, who were all men aged 32 to 36 years. Focusing on twins, who have the same DNA, would allow researchers to see how their environment affects their bodies. In each pair of twins, one brother had exercised more over the past three years than the other, though they reported they carried out similar levels of exercise earlier in their lives. Dr Kujala said: 'On average, the more active members of twin pairs were jogging three hours more per week compared to their inactive co-twins.' The twins had MRI scans of their brains so researchers could see whether physical activity had any impact on the size of their brains, and specific regions. Exercise didn't seem to affect the size of the brain as a whole, Dr Kujala said. But there was a connection between more activity and more brain volume in areas related to movement, he added. Previous research found exercise is linked to lower levels of body fat, a reduced risk of heart disease, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes The twins who exercised more did a better job of controlling their blood sugar, which reduces the risk of diabetes, a finding which is already well-known. The study was published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. It comes after US researchers found regular exercise can also make you smarter. University of South Carolina experts found\u00a0regular treadmill sessions create more mitochondria -\u00a0structures in the cells that produce the body's energy - in the brain.

The majority of these should be at level three at least for three years, with some four-year courses at level four - higher than A-levels.No more than 10% of apprenticeships should be two-year courses at level two, it says.Sir Peter said: \"Real apprenticeships are as important to social mobility as good university degrees.\"Students facing huge loans for a university education find themselves between a rock and a hard place. Even if they would prefer to work with training, the lack of good apprenticeships means they feel they have little choice.\"England's patchwork vocational system not only hinders our economic competitiveness, it prevents tens of thousands of young people from gaining good skilled jobs.\"Teresa Frith, from the Association of Colleges, said: \"Creating 300,000 apprenticeships, when the report acknowledges there is already a shortage of apprenticeship places for 16 to-year-olds, would be a massive challenge and although we agree that there is a business case for employers to take on apprentices, at the moment too few do.\"The report also says level three apprenticeships should be the priority. This isn't a bad idea in principle but some level two apprenticeships, such as those in construction, are well-respected by the industry and should be preserved.\"The report is absolutely right to say that vocational courses should only be taught in institutions with high-quality facilities and expert teaching staff and that careers advice and guidance needs to be improved.\"A Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"We are already radically reforming apprenticeships to drive up standards so that they are more rigorous and responsive to the needs of employers.\"Since 2010 over a million people have become apprentices, providing a great start to their careers. We have already insisted that apprenticeships last for a minimum of a year, include more English and maths and that every apprenticeship is a job.\"We have consulted on wider reforms to drive up standards in apprenticeships further, and will publish plans later this month.\"",

It was like living in a different world, not like living on earth.They used a blade to cut the letters RUF into my chest, so if I was thinking about escaping I knew that I could be killed if I got caught by militia who supported the government.The rebels also threatened to cut off my legs or arms if I tried to flee, and I saw this happen to other people.Sometimes they would even take out the heart from someone's chest and cook it up with onions and ask people to eat it.It seems like a nightmare now.I remember when we used to look for food and demanded that people hand it over.If they said: \"We don't have food\", we told them they were lying, and then we beat them even if they could have been telling the truth.Sometimes we were forced to kill, which we did under the influence of drugs: Marijuana was very easy to take - we used it like people drink coffee - and cocaine was also available.I was given the impression that if you took these drugs then you would be brave and if you were brave you would have the opportunity in the jungle to climb up the ranks.Luckily I did manage to escape from the jungle without being killed and I went to the capital, Freetown, but was unable to find my relatives.I lived alone, but teamed up with some guys doing things like pick-pocketing and I was caught.Fortunately [while in jail] I met a preacher called Richard Cole, who was the founder of a project called Lifeline Nehemiah which aimed to give hope, and a home, to people like me who felt they had lost hope.He encouraged me saying: \"You used to cause atrocities, but you can be used to contribute to rebuild the nation.\"At the home he encouraged me to continue with my schooling, he also told me that guys like me would be leaders of the nation and help to rebuild it.Richard taught me that it was God who was taking me through all these troubling times, and I also learnt that it was important to give back what was invested in me.He passed away in 2006 but we had that vision and continue with it.When the Ebola crisis came to Sierra Leone in 2014 we considered it to be a common enemy.We were not medical practitioners but we had the passion to change things and we decided to develop our clinic to bring in suspected Ebola cases.Through this so many lives were saved.There were three key activities.We started with education as people found it difficult to accept that Ebola was real. So we started visiting communities and explaining that it was real and it was a death sentence.We educated more than 10,000 people, and explained the message in their languages - Temne, Krio and Limba.Secondly we started supporting people by giving them food and other items. This became a massive operation - visiting 11,000 people - and started giving fresh food in urban and rural areas.Thirdly we were able to team up with other agencies and put up an Ebola treatment unit that saved so many lives.People were frightened.Sometimes when we visited people refused to accept us but as we kept coming back we became familiar to them.It was scary and some people said it was witchcraft, but we persuaded them that there were principles to observe to protect themselves.One of the worst incidents I witnessed was when I saw a pregnant woman with suspected Ebola lying in front of us.There were three others in the house who were also suspected cases and no-one could come to their house because it was too dangerous.When I saw that woman lying there I felt very bad, I came out and talked with other volunteers and after that we started to set up an Ebola treatment clinic.We didn't have any funds but we had a lot of help from local chiefs and the community, and that was how it started.Now I see my life as a changed person.I regret all that I did, but I am confident now that the future is great.We are investing in young people; I believe young people have a role in changing the world, not only Sierra Leone but the world.If we invest in them then we are building the future.11,314Deaths - probable, confirmed and suspected(Includes one in the US and six in Mali)4,808 Liberia3,955 Sierra Leone2,536 Guinea8 Nigeria",

There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.He said:  \"It is clear there is no magic bullet.\"Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.\"So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.\"The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system \"as a whole to be unfair\".He added: \"That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.\"The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.\"",

One third of the \u00a318bn cost is being provided by Chinese investors.Hours after EDF's board voted to approve the \u00a318bn power plant on Thursday, the government launched a further review of the project.This stunning new development came all the way from the top of government and the timing seemed calculated to cause maximum impact.EDF executives were taken completely off guard, the post-Brexit run of major investment is abruptly halted and what precious entente cordiale in Anglo-French relations there is left after the EU referendum result seems diminished.Is it a genuine pause for a new government to read the small print of a project that is two administrations old, or a signal of a potential change in policy?Simon Jack: Hinkley delay is a high stakes betTom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, urged the government to make a decision as soon as possible.\"We need to get on and do this and that's why I'm hoping the government make their decision very soon because if it goes on for a lengthy period of time we are going to run the risk of having real problems in terms of our energy supplies,\" he said.\"Then what happens is that we end up paying a lot more and we end up paying for much more dirty power which we can't afford to do if we are to meet our climate commitments.\"Claire Jacobson, head of climate, energy and environment policy at the EEF manufacturers' organisation said the government's decision was \"yet another blow to a decision that has been hindered by many delays and uncertainties\".Hinkley Point C is expected to provide 7% of the UK's total electricity requirement.Announcing the approval of investment on Thursday, EDF had described the plant as \"a unique asset for French and British industries\", saying it would benefit the nuclear sectors in both countries and would give a boost to employment.However, the project has been hit in recent months by concerns about EDF's financial capacity.Despite the Chinese investment, Hinkley Point would remain an enormous undertaking for the stressed French company, which has had to raise money from its owners.Earlier this week, EDF shareholders approved plans to issue new shares to raise \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.4bn) to help pay for the project.Ahead of Thursday's vote on whether to approve the project, an EDF board member, Gerard Magnin, resigned, saying the project was \"very risky\" financially.Earlier this year, EDF's finance director, Thomas Piquemal, had resigned amid reports he thought Hinkley could damage EDF itself.5,600workers on site at peak4,000km electrical cabling230,000 tonnes of steel5.6m cubic metres of earth to be movedEnvironmentalists are also concerned about the plan. Greenpeace executive director John Sauven said: \"Countless experts have warned that for British families this power station will be terrible value for money.He added that EDF's decision to go ahead with the investment, \"doesn't prove the UK is open for business post-Brexit - it just shows the Hinkley deal became too big to fail in the eyes of British and French politicians\".The campaign group added that more investment was needed for renewable energy such as offshore wind.Jan 2006 - Government proposes nuclear as part of future energy mixMar 2013 - Construction of Hinkley Point approvedOct 2013 - UK government agrees \u00a392.50 per megawatt-hour will be paid for electricity produced at the Somerset site - around double the current market rate at the timeOct 2015 - EDF signs investment agreement with China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN)July 2016 - EDF board approves final investment decision, but the UK Government postpones a final decision on the project until autumn.",

        "context": "In the aftermath of Sunday's derby disaster the talk among fans was of summer incomings to reboot a blue machine that, all-of-a-sudden, looks as outdated as a Commodore 64. Then there is the inevitable speculation over the future of under-fire manager Manuel Pellegrini. But the biggest challenge for Manchester City this summer could be keeping hold of something they already have. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero looks on dejected during the defeat by United at Old Trafford The afternoon started so well for Aguero and City when he opened the scoring after just eight minutes Aguero celebrates his 99th goal for Manchester City with David Silva as De Gea looks dejected It may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at Old Trafford but there was an important landmark for the brilliant Sergio Aguero that deserves to be recognised. The aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice-cream but the Argentine's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration. Take a minute to think where City would have been without that century. Remember THAT title-winning goal against QPR in 2012? Most, in that situation, would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from Mario Balotelli. Not Kun. The man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had City fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club's long history. That calm head, that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what City paid what now looks like a bargain \u00a338m for in 2011. Aguero netted his 100th goal for City in the 89th minute but there was no cause for celebration The Argentine strikes in injury time against QPR to win Manchester City the title in 2012 Aguero celebrates with Edin Dzeko after that goal when City scored twice in injury time to win title Aguero is settled in Manchester and signed a new five-year deal only last August. However, he now has to think of himself. If the unthinkable happens and City slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the Champions League stage? There are admirers. Real Madrid and Barcelona are both fans. Should either register an interest City would face a desperate battle to keep hold of their star man. While a move to Madrid may come with an enticing caveat in the shape of Gareth Bale, the loss of Aguero would be exceptionally difficult to recover from. Where else do you get those goals from? While it is too early in his City career to pass judgement it would appear that the burden would be too much for Wilfried Bony's broad shoulders. Wilfried Bony has only scored once in five appearances since joining City from Swansea in January City's ageing squad is in need of a major overhaul in the summer Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba is a potential target as the City owner prepares to open the cheque book The former Swansea City man, who cost just \u00a310m less than Aguero, has failed to hit the ground running since his January move and has scored only once in five appearances. The powers-that-be would no doubt have to open their chequebook but who would come to an Aguero-less City? And, should they sleepwalk out of the top four, who would dream of coming to a club without Champions League football? The likes of Paul Pogba and Raheem Sterling are potential targets. Sportsmail understands discussions have already taken place with a number of new additions. But will they also want to come to a club shorn of its idol? It is a big question and one that City will be desperate not to have to discover the answer to. Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling could also be on any list of summer targets Manuel Pellegrini is facing the sack even if Manchester City qualify for the Champions League There are others to ponder. Does Pellegrini stay? And what share of the blame do executives Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain take? Are they at fault for spending the best part of \u00a3200m since 2012 without really strengthening the team or does Pellegrini carry the can? With Financial Fair Play sanctions hurting, it was essential that City got bang for the buck. In reality they barely had a whimper. The pile on the in-tray on chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak's desk seems to be getting taller every week. It is essential that keeping Aguero is top of that ever-growing list or else that ageing blue machine risks heading for an even bigger crash.",

And he confirmed that compensation will be paid to the Easter Road club.\"Alan had another year on his contract, so we did the protocol with Hibs,\" Stewart said. \"My CEO had discussions with them to talk to Alan and that led to the appointment. We agreed a settlement with Hibs and we move forward now freely.\"We've followed Alan's career. He was on the radar months ago, the timing was right and we took the opportunity. I like the drive, the leadership.\"Football is about moving around.

I'm rather perplexed by this debate, which has been going in the UK for some time, because I view taxes as not optional.\"I view that you should pay the taxes that are legally required. It's not a debate. You pay the taxes.\"If the British system changes the tax laws, then we will comply. If the taxes go up, we will pay more, if they go down, we will pay less. That is a political decision for the democracy that is the United Kingdom.\"Meanwhile, the head of the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee, Margaret Hodge, has suggested a new committee should be established to oversee the tax arrangements of major firms.She told the Independent newspaper that such a committee could hear evidence from companies in secret, meaning that companies would not be able to hide their tax affairs behind confidentiality rules.Google, most of whose UK sales are routed through Ireland, is one of the multinationals strongly criticised for organising their tax affairs in ways that minimise the amounts they pay in the UK.Last week, European Union leaders agreed to tackle tax avoidance through an \"automatic information exchange between tax authorities\" to monitor the situation.The Google chairman has previously argued that corporate taxes should be levied in the country where it conducts economic activity and takes risks, rather than where products are consumed.He has also called for a debate on international tax reform.\"Politicians - not companies - [should] set the rules...When legislators are doing the lobbying and companies are articulating the law as it stands, it's a confusing spectacle for everyone,\" he recently wrote in the Observer.\"Our hope is to move the debate forward, with everyone engaged constructively in developing a clearer, simpler system - one in which companies that abide by the law know that the politicians who devised the rules are willing to defend and commend them.\"",

March was said to be suspicious after her husband happened to be on the scene when single mother Jones got into a car accident in LA in 2010. The source added that he denied any romance. Jones is now dating Will Forte, who she was seen with in February at the premiere of The Last Man On Earth. There was concern about this woman: The New York Daily News on Friday claimed that March asked her spouse if he had any romantic liaisons with January Jones - he allegedly said no; here Jones is pictured in March Her love interest these days:\u00a0Jones is now dating Will Forte, who she was seen with in February at the premiere of The Last Man On Earth Legal documents obtained by TMZ state that the marriage has 'broken down irretrievably.'

He has already moved out of their New York City apartment. The couple has secured their own attorneys and are discussing the terms of divorce, according to the news site. Once so close: Flay and March, who reportedly separated three weeks ago,  pictured in January 2013 TMZ went on to report that the marriage began to unravel over the past year and a half. Sources told TMZ that the union crumbled when Stephanie's appendix burst and Bobby didn't come to the hospital until the next day.

According to TMZ, Bobby attended a wine festival in Florida with his assistants instead. This will be Stephanie's first divorce and a third for Flay, whose two previous marriages both ended in divorce. In January, Flay was rumoured to be romantically involved with fellow chef Giada De Laurentiis after the 44-year-old Giada At Home star announced her split from her husband of 11 years, Todd Thompson. The Iron Chef Of America star and Giada were spotted having 'a festive dinner out together' at Cecconi's, in the private Soho Beach House, in Miami Beach on December 27, 2014, as People reported. In a statement to Gossip Cop, Giada said that any suggestion of a romance was false. Bobby has a daughter Sophie with second wife Kate Connelly, who he wed in 1995 and divorced in 1999. His first wife is Debra Ponzek, who he wed in 1991 and split from in 1993.

The 55-year-old also revealed he has a fully fit squad to choose from on Tuesday evening with Welsh attacker Gareth Bale set to return to the first team after missing Madrid's 3-0 victory against Eibar on Saturday. 'I am lucky to have the whole squad at my disposal. The formation will be the same as always. 'To play well, we will have to use all our weapons: individual quality and attacking directly with pace.

But Bale is at 100 per cent.' \u2018Bale had a fantastic season last time and scored in both finals.

Debt and the deficit could have been reduced without this scale of cuts that has been chosen by the chancellor.\"Now Scotland has to deal with the reality of the chancellor's decision. We face tough choices in the coming days.\"Against this backdrop, the Scottish government is determined that we will defend and protect the key priorities that the people of Scotland expect us to deliver on.\"Mr Swinney said schools, hospitals and the police service in Scotland would \"not be sacrificed to the chancellor's austerity obsession\".He added: \"In recent years we have been able to deliver better outcomes for the people of Scotland. More police, lower crime, better schools, tuition-free university education and a health budget that is at a record level.\"These commitments demonstrate the prioritisation of the Scottish government.\"Responding to Mr Swinney comments, a spokesman for the UK government's Scotland Office said: \"The Scottish government will have \u00a3390m more spending available to it next year, which rises to \u00a3750m if you include its own underspend.\"The stability of the UK economy means the block grant will be almost \u00a330bn.\"One look at the current oil price tells you this is a much better deal for people in Scotland than the constitutional alternative favoured by the Scottish government.\"The Scottish government should perhaps focus more on gearing up for its new powers and getting the best for Scotland, rather than grievance.\"Labour's public services spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said: \"Ahead of the most important budget since devolution, it's time John Swinney backed up his anti-austerity posturing with something real.\"Telling us about pre-election giveaways now and cuts later isn't good enough. This needs to be a long-term budget.\"Scotland needs a government that spends less time congratulating itself on its spin and more time explaining its record.\"Scottish Labour will offer a real alternative to austerity, with different decisions on tax to the Tories, and different decisions on tax to the SNP.\"",
