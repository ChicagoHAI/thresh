The preserved remains were discovered in a cardboard box by street cleaners in north-western Peru. The mummy, thought to date back to 1100 AD, was found wrapped in rope and dumped inside the box in front of an archaeological dig in the city of Trujillo. Scroll down for video Grim discovery: Street cleaners who found the remains initially feared they had stumbled across a murder victim It is thought to have been stolen from the archaeological site known as Chan Chan which was the capital of the Chimu Empire, an urban civilisation that appeared on the Peruvian coast around 1100 AD. The discovery was made in the early hours of the morning as the cleaners swept up the streets close to the dig. Cleaner Otilio Padilla Miramontes, 54, said: 'It looked just like any other box dumped on the streets. Well preserved: It turned out the 'victim' was in fact a stolen, 915-year-old Peruvian mummy Forensics: Police were called by the cleaners who made the discovery by an archaeological dig site in\u00a0Trujillo Wrapped up: The mummified remains were discovered in a box, wrapped in rope, by cleaners in Peru 'But when I opened it I nearly died of heart attack as I saw this grinning skull staring up at me. 'I had no idea it was an ancient mummy, I thought it was someone who had been murdered so I immediately called the police.' A police spokesman said: 'We quickly established that this was not a recent skeleton. 'But we are now investigating how it ended up in a box outside of the main archaeological site. 'Our suspicion is that someone tried to steal it and had maybe left it in the box to collect later.' The remains were taken to the regional Directorate of Culture for examination. A spokesman there said: 'This is not a Chimu mummy and is most likely pre-Hispanic suggesting it is from another culture pre-dating the Hispanic arrival.'",

He was so big that it took Shepherd John Hendy and a team of three helpers to help mother Jean deliver the young lamb near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, who they've now named Big Ben. Suffolk black lamb Jean is seven years old and an experienced mother but Ben is twice the weight of all his brothers and sisters born before him, all weighing the average weight of 8-10lbs. Big Ben: the 20lb lamb is twice the weight of the average new-born, towering over peers Proud mum: Jean with huge son Big Ben after a three-hour labour at a Leicestershire farm Ben isn't the biggest lamb ever born in this country but Jean Morris from the farm said Big Ben was comfortably the biggest they have ever delivered. 'I don't think there was anything unusual about either parent and this is the first time we have bred a lamb as large as this,' she said. 'His mother must have been relieved when it was over.' She added that the farm hopes to keep Ben as a breeding ram in the hope he will pass his amazing features to his future flock. 'This year we had 86 ewes to lamb but no-one expected anyone like him,' she said. 'We are thinking about keeping him as a tup - a breeding ram - to see if he passes on his weight to the lambs he sires.' Almost as big as a person: Ben dwarfs the other 86 ewes born at the same farm this season Ben's arrival came just a fortnight after the largest lamb born in the UK weighed in at a massive 24lbs in north Wales. He was named The Big One and is believed to be the heaviest lamb ever born in the wild. Last year Goliath was born at a hefty 22lbs 5oz in Wellington in Somerset. The title for the heaviest Suffolk cross lamb was Bruno, nicknamed 'Woooly Lamboth', who was born in Worcestershire in 2009 at a healthy 21lbs. Bruno was spared the chop because of his size as his owner decided to keep him as a pet because he was curious to know just how big he would get. New Zealand is the world's biggest producer of lambs.

        "context": "The pursuit of journalists for paying public officials was in ruins last night after prosecutors dropped a raft of cases. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders was forced into a humiliating climbdown after a jury threw out yet another Old Bailey case. She abandoned the trials of nine reporters accused of illegally paying public officials for information, finally admitting there was little appetite among the public for journalists who expose matters of public interest to be jailed. Former Mirror reporter Graham Brough talks to media as he leaves the Old Bailey court in London after he and three other tabloid journalists were cleared of paying public officials for stories Her decision sparked an ugly blame game as the architects of the \u00a320million \u2018politically-motivated witch hunt\u2019 turned against each other. Prosecutors and police pointed the finger at the Leveson inquiry and MPs for whipping up a storm of hysteria over the work of the Press. And Scotland Yard highlighted how their inquiries were possible only thanks to millions of confidential emails released by News International. The man in charge at the start of the tainted Met Police probe into tabloid journalists \u2013 Operation Elveden \u2013 was former DPP and now Labour parliamentary candidate Keir Starmer. Last night campaigners questioned why the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was still putting three journalists in the dock for the same supposed offences. One senior figure said \u2018enough is enough\u2019, adding: \u2018It was always wrong for journalists to have been prosecuted for doing their jobs.\u2019 The landmark U-turn came yesterday after a jury threw out the case against three Sun journalists and one former Daily Mirror reporter. Lucy Panton, former News of the World crime reporter, had her conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal after being the first to be found guilty Brandon Malinsky, Neil Millard and Tom Wells, as well as their Fleet Street rival Graham Brough, were cleared of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. They were accused of funnelling cash to public officials in exchange for leaks from inside some of Britain\u2019s most secure jails. But the jury found that exposing how taxpayers\u2019 cash was wasted on bingo games for illegal immigrants and lavished on child killer Jon Venables was not a crime. Within hours, the CPS threw in the towel on nine other cases, including fresh prosecutions and retrials. The decision followed a review sparked by the Court of Appeal quashing the conviction of the first journalist to be convicted. It can now be revealed for the first time that ex-News of the World crime editor Lucy Panton was found guilty of bribing officials only for her conviction to be overturned. Some of the most senior judges in the country criticised how the archaic law of misconduct in public office \u2013 under which prosecutions were brought \u2013 had been applied, fatally undermining other cases. The CPS move leaves Operation Elveden in tatters. Of the 27 journalists charged, 23 have been cleared, had their cases dropped or seen their convictions quashed or founder at the Court of Appeal. In addition, 14 journalists were investigated, including many left on bail for many months, but not prosecuted. Three Sun journalists \u2013 news editor Chris Pharo, crime reporter Anthony France and reporter Jamie Pyatt \u2013 still face trial. A decision must be made within a week over whether Tom Wells should be retried on one charge on which the jury could not reach a verdict. By contrast, 21 of the 28 public officials \u2013 including police, prison officers and Ministry of Defence staff \u2013 charged under the inquiry have been convicted. Prosecutors faced a furious attack in the wake of yesterday\u2019s decision. Media commentator Roy Greenslade said it was \u2018remarkable\u2019 that prosecutors were still pursuing three Sun journalists, adding: \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019 The Sun newspaper reporter Tom Wells (left) leaves the Old Bailey court with colleague Neil Millard (right) The Sun's night news editor Brandon Malinsky (left) had his case dropped today. The jury could not decide on one count against former Serco immigration detention centre official Mark Blake (right) Speaking outside the Old Bailey, Mr Malinsky said he had endured \u2018two years of torture\u2019. He added: \u2018I think the police and CPS have been a disgrace bringing my case and other cases to court. It\u2019s a disgraceful waste of public money.\u2019 The nine journalists whose forthcoming cases have been dropped include ex-Mirror reporter Greig Box-Turnbull and Stephen Moyes of the News of the World. Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson and royal editor Clive Goodman will not face retrials because prosecutors said it was no longer in the public interest. Sun reporter Vince Soodin, former deputy news editor Ben O\u2019Driscoll and former Sun managing editor Graham Dudman will also not be prosecuted. The final two reporters to be told they face no further action are Panton and Ryan Sabey, who has been convicted but has leave to appeal, something the CPS said it will not contest. Mrs Saunders said the original police inquiry was \u2018inevitable\u2019 and left prosecutors with a \u2018duty\u2019 to act. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

        "context": "Spain's 2-0 defeat by Holland on Tuesday brought back bitter memories of their disastrous 2014 World Cup, but coach Vicente del Bosque will not be too worried about a third straight friendly defeat, insists Gerard Pique. Holland, whose 5-1 drubbing of Spain in the group stage in Brazil last year marked the end of the Iberian nation's six-year domination of the world game, scored two early goals at the Amsterdam Arena and held on against some determined Spain pressure in the second half for a 2-0 success. They became the first team to inflict two defeats on Del Bosque since he took over in 2008 but the gruff 64-year-old had used the match to try out several new faces and he fielded a largely experimental, second-string team. Stefan de Vrij (right) headed Holland in front against Spain at the Amsterdam Arena on Tuesday Gerard Pique (left) could do nothing to stop Davy Klaassen doubling the Dutch advantage Malaga forward Juanmi and Sevilla midfielder Vitolo became the 55th and 56th players to debut under Del Bosque, while the likes of goalkeeper David de Gea, defenders Raul Albiol, Juan Bernat and Dani Carvajal and midfielder Mario Suarez all started the game. 'The national team's state of health is good,' centre back Gerard Pique told reporters. 'We are in a process where players are coming into the team and gathering experience,' added the Barcelona defender. 'We are second in qualifying (for Euro 2016) and these friendly games are for experimenting. 'I am not that worried about this match because we lost friendlies in previous years and then ended up winning titles.' David de Gea was given a start by Vicente del Bosque but could not keep out De Vrij's header here Dani Carvajal (centre) was another squad player given a chance to impress against Holland Del Bosque will be confident he can find the right mix of players to secure Spain's berth at Euro 2016 in France next year, when they will be chasing an unprecedented third straight title. Slovakia are the surprise leaders in qualifying Group C thanks to a 2-1 win over Spain in Zilina in October and have a maximum 15 points from five of 10 matches. Spain are second on 12 points, three ahead of Ukraine, who they beat 1-0 in Seville on Friday. Del Bosque's side host Slovakia in September in a match that could decide who goes through to the finals as group winners. 'The team is in good shape,' forward Pedro told reporters. 'We have a very clear idea of our playing style and we are able to count on people who are gradually making a place for themselves in the team.'",

The bail hearing revealed that Kyhesha-Lee\u00a0suffered blows to her stomach causing severe bowel damage- ultimately leading to her death. The bail hearing revealed Kyesha-Lee succumbed to massive bowel injuries after being struck days before her death Kyhesha-Lee\u00a0was in the care of her father Matthew Lee Williamson and Christopher Arthur Neville Kent who have both been charged with manslaughter and child cruelty. Crown prosecutor Vicki Loury alleged the toddler also suffered a penetrative injury to her vagina three days before her death. She was not seen of or heard of by anyone else in the five days prior to her death, although another man visited the home the night before Kyhesha-Lee\u00a0died. 'She was by that stage in severe distress, extremely unwell,' Ms Loury told the court. Kyhesha-Lee Joughin \u00a0was allegedly locked in a bedroom by her father, forcing her to defecate and urinate in the room Kyhesha-Lee's body was found days after she suffered the blows - allegedly in squalid surroundings - at the unit she shared with her father in Petrie, north of Brisbane, on March 30, 2013. Kent, 46, was granted bail in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Wednesday after the court heard he'd offered to plead guilty on the basis of criminal negligence. Williamson allegedly locked his daughter in the bedroom while he slept during the day, forcing her to defecate and urinate in the room. Her father Matthew Lee Williamson and his friend Christopher Arthur Neville Kent, who also lived in the house and cared for the child in the days prior to her death, are each charged with manslaughter and child cruelty. They have both been released on bail Evidence of the child's blood had been found on Kent's shorts. 'It was a small unit, he must have been aware of what was happening with the child,' Ms Loury said. Chief Magistrate Ray Rinaudo agreed with Kent's barrister Soraya Ryan that the accused no longer presented a risk of fleeing or re-offending on bail. Kyhesha-Lee's body was found - allegedly in squalid surroundings - at the unit she shared with her father in Petrie, north of Brisbane, on March 30, 2013 Magistrate Rinaudo said he was ultimately swayed by Kent's steps towards taking responsibility for the 'tragic' events by his plea offer. Kent was bailed with strict conditions including daily reporting to police and restrictions on entering the homes of children under 16. Both he and Williamson are due to face a committal hearing next month. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

        "context": "(The Hollywood Reporter)Stan Freberg, whose freewheeling comic career in advertising garnered him worldwide acclaim and whose satirical entertainments abounded on TV, the radio and on records, has died. He was 88. Freberg died of natural causes at a Santa Monica hospital, his son and daughter, Donavan and Donna Freberg, confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. \"He was and will always be my hero, and I will carry his brilliant legacy forward as best I am able,\" his son wrote on Facebook. The godfather of humorous and irreverent commercials, Freberg lampooned cultural institutions and described himself as a \"guerilla satirist.\" The New York Times dubbed him the \"Che Guevara of advertising,\" and years later, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic called him a major influence on his career. \"Very sad to say that one of my absolute all-time heroes has just passed away,\" Yankovic wrote on Twitter. \"RIP Stan Freberg. A legend, an inspiration, and a friend.\" Freberg also was known for his musical parodies. \"Wun'erful Wun'erful,\" his 1957 spoof of \"champagne music\" \u2014 on which he collaborated with orchestra leader Billy May \u2014 lampooned \"The Lawrence Welk Show.\" He also parodied Johnnie Ray's hit \"Cry,\" which Freberg rendered as \"Try.\" (Ray was quite angry until he realized Freberg was fueling sales of his record.) The Los Angeles native had hit records of his own, including \"St. George and the Dragonet,\" a 1953 send-up of the series \"Dragnet.\" His recordings were so popular that he landed his own radio program in 1954, \"That's Rich.\" Three years later, he presented \"The Stan Freberg Show\" on CBS Radio, where he regularly mocked commercials by advertising bogus products. Hollywood Reporter: \"Mad Men's\" return He won a Grammy Award in 1959 for best performance, documentary or spoken word for \"The Best of the Stan Freberg Shows.\" Earlier in the 1950s, Freberg helped create and write the Emmy Award-winning comedy \"Time for Beany,\" also working with puppets and performing on the show. Its droll, off-the-wall humor appealed to fans including Albert Einstein. During Beany's early gestation, he and the other writers had no office, so they wrote in coffee shops at night as well as in an \"office\" in a condemned building. Not surprisingly, Freberg ruffled institutional feathers. Capitol Records balked at releasing his satires of radio-TV personality Arthur Godfrey and Ed Sullivan's variety show \"Toast of the Town.\" Hollywood Reporter: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" -- the untold story Freberg disdained the hard sell. He created such classic comic ad capers as \"Nine out of 10 doctors recommend Chun King Chow Mein,\" and his Jeno's Frozen Pizza campaign featured the Lone Ranger and Tonto. He skewered the greed of the ad business in \"Green Chri$tma$, which criticized the over-commercialization of the holiday. In 1958, Freberg opened his own ad agency, Freberg Ltd. His slogan was \"More Honesty Than the Client Had in Mind,\" and he even had a corporate motto: \"Ars Gratia Pecuniae\" (Art of the Sake of Money). Freberg, whose inspirations were Jack Benny, Fred Allen and Norman Corwin, worked in cartoons for decades, starting in the 1940s. He provided the voice for Junyer Bear in the 1948 Chuck Jones Looney Tunes cartoon \"What's Brewin', Bruin,\" and he famously played the three pigs, the wolf and the singing narrator in another Looney Tunes classic, 1957's \"Three Little Bops.\" He teamed often at Warner Bros. with the great Mel Blanc. Freberg also was the voice of Beaver in Disney's \"Lady and the Tramp\" (1955). For the feature Looney Tunes, \"Back in Action\" (2003), he was heard as a baby bear. Survivors also include his wife, Hunter, and a granddaughter. \u00a92015 The Hollywood Reporter. All rights reserved.",

The $40 billion taxi service has been plagued by serious accusations of failing to vet its drivers. Lawsuits have been brought against Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles. A New Delhi driver was accused of raping a passenger in December. This week in Denver, a driver tried and failed to break into a passenger's home. And in London, a woman was allegedly asked to perform oral sex on her driver. These claims, among others, follow a data leak last May, which saw the details of 50,000 current and former drivers released into the public domain. It is hoped Sullivan, the first federal prosecutor to specialize in high-technology crime, can protect Uber from potentially crippling ramifications. Lifeline? Joe Sullivan, 46, will leave his role as Facebook's security chief to help Uber defend safety concerns There were three high-profile assault cases involving Uber drivers in December 2014. An Indian woman said her driver raped her in New Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. It came days after a driver was charged in Boston with raping a young woman. The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered \u00a320 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. This week in Denver an UberX driver was arrested after he dropped a passenger off at the airport before allegedly driving back to her house, and trying to break in. The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles are both suing the company for 'misleading the public' by failing to conduct thorough backgrounds checks. The firm's first security chief, he brings with him an extensive portfolio of experience in cyber security and privacy. He spent two decades tackling cyber crime security in the private and public sector before joining the Justice Department. Cases included child protection, bank privacy, and digital strands of 9/11 investigations. Since, he has headed up the security departments at eBay, PayPal, and Facebook. Though his experience lies in digital protection, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has also entrusted the 46-year-old with tackling physical security. Sullivan's role will involve liaising with city and state governments around the world as the firm rapidly expands. Announcing the hire in a blog post\u00a0on Thursday Kalanick wrote: 'We are both in cyberspace and on city streets all at once; a bridge between bits and atoms. 'And as we get into tens of millions of rides a week, we continue to challenge ourselves to do even better when it comes to safety and data security.' He added: 'This is a challenge where I get to take what makes Silicon Valley special and apply it to a product that directly impacts people's lives everyday as they move around the world's cities.'

        "context": "Richie Benaud has passed away  at the age of 84 after a short battle with skin cancer but the man who spoke with an unrivalled blend of insight, authority and wit from commentary boxes at cricket matches across the globe will always be remembered. Here, Sportsmail recounts 10 of his finest moments from his broadcasting career. Richie Benaud, one of cricket's great personalities, has died at the age of 84 after battling skin cancer 1. BALL OF THE CENTURY Benaud was on hand to talk viewers through Shane Warne's first test delivery for Australia in England in the 1993 Ashes, which turned out to be a stunning dismissal of Mike Gatting. 2. AUSTRALIA'S UNDERARM BALL Benaud was renowned for his calming tone as broadcaster but his pure disdain for Trevor Chappell's underarm delivery for Australia against New Zealand in 1981 is equally as memorable. 'One of the worst things I have ever seen done on a cricket field,' he raged from the Channel Nine studio. 3. LAST SPELL OF COMMENTARY IN ENGLAND Benaud's final commentary duties for Channel 4 came in the fifth Ashes Test at The Oval in 2005 and was commemorated by members of the crowd waving banners in tribute. 4. 'YOU'VE GOT TO CHECK IF THEY'RE STILL THERE!' Benaud's  cricketing knowledge was matched with sharp turn of humour, an example being when he saw a player get hit by a cricket ball in a place no man wishes to get hit. 5. ANDREW SYMONDS STOPS A STREAKER Thankfully, Benaud was on hand to embellish one of cricket's more bizarre moments during a one-day international between Australia and India. 6. TRIBUTE TO PHILLIP HUGHES Benaud narrated Channel Nine's powerful tribute to Phillip Hughes in November 2014. 7. GEOFFREY BOYCOTT RUNS OUT DEREK RANDALL Now a commentator himself, one can only imagine the uproar if Geoffrey Boycott saw a modern day player run his batting partner out in the reckless manner he did to Derek Randall. But Benaud's take was typically measured. 8. BENAUD COMPARES DON BRADMAN WITH SACHIN TENDULKAR Benaud's fascinating dissection of Sachin Tendulkar's capabilities compared to Don Bradman show not only what an encyclopedic knowledge of cricket he possessed, but also how his understanding of the game evolved alongside the sport itself. 9. BENAUD ON BOTHAM Sir Ian Botham's ferocious unbeaten 149 for England in the 3rd Test of the 1981 Ashes at Headingly had Benaud unleashing some of his best lines. 10. INTRODUCING 'AUSTRALIA'S BIGGEST SUMMER OF CRICKET EVER' One of Benaud's final pieces of work saw him introduce Australia's cricketing summer of 2014, where he looked ahead to his home country co-hosting the World Cup. His enthusiasm is vibrant and infectious, with his voice galvanised by excitement. P.S... HE COULD PLAY, TOO! Benaud excelled as a broadcaster and his voice will always conjure memories of cricket's greatest moments but before embarking on a media career, he was a magnificent player. He captained Australia during their domination of the game during the late 1950's, spearheading their success with a flamboyant, forward-thinking style of leadership. He was the first man to score over 2,000 runs and take more than 200 wickets in Tests and one of his finest dismissals came against England in 1958.",

At the end of last month, the young royal, who lives three and a half thousand miles away from her family in the UK, celebrated her 25th birthday. In the middle of a Palace function, her father, Prince Andrew, whipped out his iPad and used it to video call his daughter, who currently lives in Manhattan. The shop stocks trendy brands including Stella McCartney, Proenza Schouler, Missoni, J Brand and Chloe If that wasn\u2019t enough, the prince got his 400-strong audience in the State Apartments at St James\u2019s Palace to sing a cheery rendition of Happy Birthday, accompanied by a trumpeter from the Scots Guards. The royal, who was hosting the Pitch@Palace event for entrepreneurs, introduced the stunned audience to the singalong at St James\u2019s Palace, saying: \u2018We are going to do something new this evening. \u2018The lady in the middle is my youngest daughter and it\u2019s her 25th birthday today.\u2019 Laughing Eugenie, wearing a pair of novelty birthday candle glasses to mark the occasion, and accompanied by her sister, Princess Beatrice, and mother, Sarah, Duchess of York, smiled and waved. Andrew told her: \u2018You will notice that we have somebody here to play (gesturing to the trumpeter).\u2019 He then turned to the lance corporal and added: \u2018If you will lead us in Happy Birthday please...\u2019 There were cheers from the crowd as the song came to an end, while plenty of others waved and tried to capture the moment on their camera phones. Eugenie looked delighted and said she was \u2018very proud, Pops\u2019 of her father\u2019s role in the awards, which celebrate innovation and technology in the creative industries. But the singalong did not impress his ex-wife, who joked - in the style of a Eurovision announcement - that the rendition scored \u2018zero points\u2019. The Duke of York holds an iPad as he invites the audience at the Pitch@Palace event to sing happy birthday via FaceTime to his daughter Princess Eugenie Sarah added: \u2018We think you all need to go for choir practice.\u2019 Andrew, however, was content with the gesture. \u2018Having been told this was a bad idea, it worked,\u2019 he said. The Prince, who used a Pitch@Palace event last year to send the first royal selfie, joked: \u2018\u2019What was it somebody said about children and dogs?\u2019 The social media-savy Royal is also the only senior working royal to have his own personal Twitter account.

        "context": "The country\u2019s biggest food bank organisation yesterday claimed the number of people claiming free meal packages from its branches passed a million last year. The figures from the Trussell Trust were seized on by Labour and the TUC as \u2018shocking\u2019 evidence that millions need emergency food because of low pay, the so-called bedroom tax, and stopped benefits. But Tory benefits chief Iain Duncan Smith questioned the numbers, which he said were \u2018unverified\u2019, and insisted that the best way to help families was to get people into work. The Trussel Trust claimed that 1 million people are being fed from food banks such as this one in Glasgow Another independent food bank organisation warned that such figures could be misleading because food banks are a new phenomenon and should not be used as a \u2018political football\u2019. The row comes amid growing controversy over the spread of food banks \u2013 said by supporters to show that hunger is commonplace and need overwhelming, and by critics to show that when free food is handed out, people will always come forward to take it. Yesterday\u2019s report from the Trust put the number of people who were given three days\u2019 worth of food at one of its 445 branches in the past financial year at 1,084,604. Its UK director Adrian Curtis said: \u2018Despite welcome signs of economic recovery, hunger continues to affect significant numbers of men, women and children. The latest figures highlight how vital it is that we all work to prevent and relieve hunger in the UK.\u2019 The latest figures show a slowdown in the numbers visiting food banks, with a rise of under 100,000 in numbers recorded since 2013-14, when there were 913,138 food bank visits. Iain Duncan Smith, pictured, dismissed the suggestion claims suggesting that the Trussell Trust's figures are 'unverified' This figure was almost three times the 2012-13 level of 346,992. In 2009-10 the Trust recorded 40,898 food bank visits. The claims have been disputed because the Trussell Trust counts numbers of food bank visits in which people are given three-day food packages, and not numbers of individuals. This means an unknown number make repeat visits, and some analysts say the real total of people who went to food banks may be closer to half a million. Research carried out by the Trust, Oxfam, the Church of England and other charities last year also found that low pay is only a minor reason for people going to get aide from food banks. It found that more than four out of five users live on state benefits and only one out of 40 users questioned was working on a zero hours contract. A chorus of political leaders and charities lined up to criticise David Cameron over the figures. Labour\u2019s work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves said: \u2018The shocking rise in the number of people relying on Trussell Trust food banks since 2010 shows the Tory plan is failing. \u2018David Cameron\u2019s failure to tackle low pay, the bedroom tax and delays in benefit payments have led to over a million people depending on emergency food aid.\u2019 TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: \u2018This should make all of us ashamed, particularly those who claim everyone is sharing in the recovery. It tells us that the Government has done grave damage to the welfare safety net. \u2018Vicious sanctions and benefit cuts \u2013 even for those who paid in all their working lives \u2013 are destroying the support any of us might need if we lose our job or have an accident.\u2019 Oxfam poverty chief Rachael Orr said: \u2018It is extremely worrying to see yet another rise in the number of people being forced to visit food banks in the UK.\u2019 The picture of millions going hungry contrasts with the findings of the respected US-based Social Progress Index published earlier this month, which put Britain in first place out of 133 countries for its success in conquering hunger. Mr Duncan Smith said the Trust\u2019s figures were \u2018unverified\u2019. He added: \u2018We are not going to take lectures from the party who presided over the deepest recession in living memory \u2013 whose incompetent economic policies hit the poorest harder than anyone. \u2018The best way to help families provide for themselves is cut taxes and to get more people into work \u2013 and we\u2019ve got a strong record there: two million more people in work since the last election. Frances O'Grady, Trade Union Congress general secretary, pictured, described the figure as 'shameful' \u2018It is only by continuing with our term economic plan that will we ensure more people have a job and the economic security that comes with it.\u2019 The Oxford Food Bank, which is independent of the Trussell Trust network, urged caution in the interpretation of food bank figures. The organisation, which distributes food to other charities which provide meals, rather than handing it out to individuals, said: \u2018We think that increasing use of food banks is an unreliable guide to underlying need because food banks are a new phenomenon \u2013 whereas food poverty is not. \u2018As an organisation which draws its volunteers and donors from across the entire population of Oxford, we adopt a non-political stance. To do anything else would risk disenfranchising a section of that support. \u2018The issue of food banks and food poverty should not be used in a game of political football when the statistical evidence is so potentially misleading. We congratulate the Trussell Trust on the success of their operation but we also believe that successive governments have ignored the issue of waste in the food cycle. \u2018It is high time the OFB model of food bank \u2013 which prevents food being wasted and combats food poverty \u2013 is encouraged and replicated elsewhere.\u2019",

        "context": "Lewis Hamilton has conceded to feeling more powerful now than at any stage in his F1 career. It is an ominous warning from a man who has won nine of the last 11 grands prix, been on pole at the last four, and who already holds a 27-point cushion in the drivers' standings. It is no wonder after winning in Bahrain, when Hamilton stepped out of his Mercedes, he immediately stood on top of it and pretended to smack an imaginary baseball out of the circuit. Lewis Hamilton stands on his Mercedes after winning the Bahrain\u00a0Grand Prix It was another 'home run' performance from Hamilton, a man who claims he is a perfectionist, and who appears to be driving as close to perfection as can possibly be achieved in the sport. It led to the suggestion that perhaps he was feeling unbeatable, to which he replied: 'I don't know what the feeling of being unbeatable is. 'I know I feel very powerful in this car with the package we have, and I feel I'm able to get everything from it. 'I also feel more comfortable in this car than I did in the one last year, and I feel within myself, with whatever approach I have, the power is greater than ever in terms of strength in the car. 'It's like 'yes'. I put the car there and it goes there, I get the exit. 'Naturally you always feel there are things you can still improve on, but it's hard to always pinpoint what those are and to tell the team what to focus on. Hamilton is congratulated by Ferrari rival Kimi Raikkonen on Sunday 'That's what a team leader has to do, and, along with Nico (Rosberg), I'm trying to guide the team, to tell them where to go next.' So just how close to perfection does Hamilton feel? 'There are always areas. I'll look and think 'Could I have braked later for the pit entry? Could I have done a better outlap?' said the 30-year-old. 'I feel I'm doing the best I can, and I'm learning and improving at the same time, which is all I can ask for.' Yet do not dare to suggest to Hamilton that he does not work as hard off the track in terms of poring over every aspect of what is required to ensure he is at one with his car. In being compared with former McLaren team-mate Jenson Button in the past, or Rosberg at present, the feeling has generally been they are more studious than Hamilton, who simply just drives. 'Of course I analyse. You can't be a world champion without doing that,' Hamilton said. 'I remember speaking about this a long time ago and I don't know if people get a perception as to who you are as a driver, but I work as hard as any other driver. 'Just because I do things differently it doesn't mean I'm worse. Race winner Hamilton celebrates with the trophy on the podium in Bahrain 'There was a point where people said Nico was a doctor of this or that; Jenson was a doctor of his tyres. 'I tick off all the boxes, and I've worked to do that. 'The results I get are not only from my raw ability because I study hard, I work hard to make notes about my tyres, about every single thing I do, which I've done since my days in Formula Three. 'Ultimately, I don't care what people think. I just do the job.' Hamilton certainly has Rosberg scratching his head as the German appears to have run out of ideas as to how to beat his main rival. Hamilton has now set a personal record run of 11 consecutive grands prix in the points - twice finishing second in addition to the nine wins. If you include the double points for the final race of last season, Hamilton has scored an astonishing 286 from a potential 300. It is not perfection, so perhaps there is a feeling of never being quite satisfied. 'That's natural for anyone who has the competitiveness I have,' said Hamilton. 'I know the potential I have, and whether or not I'm living up to it. 'I feel I am coming close to full potential - although who knows exactly what that is - but I do feel quite satisfied.' Which is why he also feels he still has more to give, starting with the next grand prix in three weeks' time in Spain. 'I got the pole, I did the job (in Bahrain),' Hamilton said.

The country is due to repay a \u00a3330million loan to the International Monetary Fund on Thursday but there were concerns the heavily indebted nation would default on the payment. Deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas said that Greece will in fact make the payment on time. Greece has denied it will miss a repayment of \u00a3330million to the International Monetary Fund after reports it had drawn up plans to introduce a parallel drachma currency to pay its bills He said: 'We strive to be able to pay our obligations on time. We are ready to pay on April 9.' Sources close to the ruling Syriza party claimed the government was prioritising paying wages and pensions over any loans due, according to the Telegraph. It  reported that the nation no longer has the funds to repay the debt unless the eurozone agrees to pay the next portion of its interim bail-out deal in time. A senior official told the newspaper: 'We are a Left-wing government. If we have to choose between a default to the IMF or a default to our own people, it is a no-brainer. 'We may have to go into a silent arrears process with the IMF. This will cause a furore in the markets and means that the clock will start to tick much faster.' German magazine Der Spiegel quoted a finance ministry general secretary, Nikos Theocharakis, as saying Greece would probably not pay next week's IMF tranche, prompting a further denial from the Greek finance ministry. Theocharakis said Greece would be 'close to the end' on April 9 and called the technical teams from its creditors 'completely useless,' according to an extract of the article due to be published on Saturday. 'Mr. Theocharakis never characterised the technical teams of the institutions with the phrase attributed to him,' the ministry said in a statement. 'On the contrary ... he referred to them as saying they include 'top-notch people with impressive skills.'' Deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas (pictured) said that Greece will in fact make the payment on time Germany's Spiegel Online quoted Belgian Finance Minister Johan Van Overtveldt as saying that Greece postponing the repayment due on April 9 was 'out of the question', otherwise a Greek exit from the eurozone could no longer be ruled out. He said the Eurogroup would not release further funds to Greece until Athens implemented some of the reforms it had promised. Athens has not received bailout funds since August last year and has resorted to measures such as borrowing from state entities via repo transactions to tide it through the cash crunch. The government is hoping approval of its latest reforms package will unlock remaining aid of 7.2 billion euros under its EU/IMF bailout and lead to the return of about 1.9 billion euros in profits made by the European Central Bank on Greek bonds. Mardas said, without providing figures, that state revenue in March had topped targets and that the government had made progress in talks with lenders on its latest reforms list. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said Greece would receive fresh funds only once its creditors approve the reforms Athens has presented.",

        "context": "A former Utah high school teacher accused of having sex with three of her male students took a plea deal Wednesday to avoid a trial, sobbing as she accepted the agreement in court. One of the boys was 16 and two were 17 when they were having sex with Davis High School English teacher Brianne Altice, 35. One testified that he considered her to be his girlfriend during their yearlong tryst. But the boys were all minors, and Utah law also says a person cannot consent to sex if the other person is in a position of special trust. Altice could face up to 45 years in prison when she is sentenced next month. Scroll down for video Guilty: Former Davis High School English teacher Brianne Altice, 35, pictured here in court on Wednesday, pleaded guilty to three counts of forcible sexual abuse involving three male students Lengthy prison sentence: Altice accepted the agreement in exchange for prosecutors dropping 11 other counts, including several first-degree felonies. She could face up to 45 years in prison when she is sentenced next month Altice pleaded guilty to three counts of forcible sexual abuse in exchange for prosecutors dropping 11 other counts, including several first-degree felonies. School officials knew about Altice's inappropriate behavior and didn't do enough to protect the students, the boys and their parents say. In one of two lawsuits filed against the Davis School District, the plaintiffs said the running joke at the high school was, \u2018Who is Ms. Altice sleeping with now?\u2019 Davis School District spokesman Chris Williams said he would love to comment on the allegations but that the civil lawsuit precludes him from saying anything. Prosecutor Susan Hunt said the three victims are on board with the plea deal, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. Altice is scheduled to be sentenced May 28. Each count carries a possible sentence of 1 to 15 years in prison. Altice's attorney, Ed Brass, said his client wanted to resolve a case to avoid risking an uncertain outcome at trial. Brass previously defended Altice, saying she was no longer the boys' teacher when the sex occurred. Altice's attorney said his client, pictured in court back in January, wanted to resolve a case to avoid risking an uncertain outcome at trial Altice was first arrested in October 2013 after a student reported having a relationship with her. Two more victims later came forward with similar allegations. She was out on bail during most of the criminal proceedings until allegations emerged earlier this year that she had sex with the third victim following her 2013 arrest. A judge ordered her to jail, where she's been for the three months. Brass asked the judge Wednesday to let Altice out on bail until her sentencing, but the judge denied the request. Brianne Altice was hired by the Davis County School District in 2004 and had been teaching at the high school since August 2012. She was put on leave from the school after the allegations came to light and later fired in February 2014. She had been ordered last month to stand trial on 14 felony charges, including rape, sodomy, sexual abuse and sex with a minor, in connection\u00a0to her suspected affairs with three students. In mid-March, one of the alleged victims brought a $647,000 lawsuit against the Davis County School District accusing officials of negligence for failing to fire the 'flirtatious' teacher before she started a sexual relationship with him. More legal trouble: Two students have filed lawsuits against the Davis County School District in Utah accusing officials of failing to fire English teacher Brianne Altice, pictured in court in January, who is accused of having\u00a0sex with three boys Earlier this month, another student sued the district for hiring Altice, reported The Salt Lake Tribune. Court documents detailed how at times, the students skipped other classes and spent entire days with Altice, sent her text messages and made explicit comments to her. On her part, the 35-year-old Altice confided in her teenage admirers about her martial problems. According to the complaint, the relationship between the woman and the boys in her class eventually turned physical. Similarly to the first lawsuit, the new complaint alleged that the school district was aware of Brianne Altice's inappropriate behavior but failed to take action against her. She allegedly had sex with the third student while she was out on \u00a0bail for charges relating to the first two students. The student who brought the initial lawsuit in March accused the district of being negligent when it hired Altice and says it is responsible for the damage she inflicted on him. He claimed they started a relationship in early 2013 after they flirted during class and texted and ultimately started kissing and having sex. He stated that the school district had reprimanded Altice after seeing photos of her having inappropriate contact with students but she was not fired, the Tribune reported. Despite the claims against her, one of her alleged victims has previously testified that the charges against Altice are 'ridiculous' and 'she doesn't deserve to be here'. In trouble: Altice, pictured at a hearing in February 2014, allegedly had sex with the boys from early 2013 One of her victims has accused the school district of failing to fire the English teacher, left, even though it knew she had acted inappropriately with students. She was first taken into custody in 2013 He told the court he had sex with Altice once prior to October 2013 - when she was initially arrested - and then three more times after that in December, while she was out on bail. In August 2014, a second student came forward to say he had also had a physical relationship with the former Davis High English teacher, whose marriage fell apart in the aftermath of the scandal.",

Klopp, 47, announced earlier this week that he would end his seven-year stint at Borussia Dortmund when the current season draws to a close, prompting fresh speculation that he could head for the Premier League. Manchester City have already indicated that a man who has also been linked with Manchester United and Arsenal in the past, is not in their sights, but Germany international Mertesacker insists Klopp would be a good fit in the English top flight. Jurgen Klopp has revealed he will be vacating his role as Borussia Dortmund boss at the end of the season Arsenal vice-captain Per Mertesacker says Klopp would be a top manager in the Premier League Klopp chats with Dortmund defender Erik Durm during a training session in Dortmund on Wednesday He said: 'I've got some nice experiences in the Premier League and of course it would be nice if a German coach would take the challenge of working in the Premier League. 'It's not so good for Dortmund that he is leaving but hopefully one day he will manage abroad. I think his passion would fit and to see him in England would be very interesting. 'Everyone has their philosophy and I think Jurgen Klopp has proved that he's top-level and can teach a lot.' However, Mertesacker insisted Klopp, whose side are 10th in the Bundesliga table, will need time to decide on his future after a largely successful spell in Dortmund which has brought two league titles and a Champions League final appearance. He said: 'I think he should just finish the season with Dortmund and then he should be given time. 'We'll see what he does next, but I think he's fought his way out of all situations and I think that this time he will find a path that gives him a new challenge. 'But firstly, I wish him all the best and time to think about his achievements. Sometimes you can underestimate what it's like going straight into a new job. I think you should give him time - and I wish him all the best.' Klopp waves to the fans after Dortmund's Champions League game against Arsenal in November The German boss has enjoyed a huge amount of success at Dortmund and won the Bundesliga title twice But for all that a new challenge lies ahead for Klopp, Mertesacker admits he cannot work out what has gone wrong to prompt his exit from Borussia. He said: 'It is obviously sad news for Borussia Dortmund, [he was] such a passionate successful and passionate manager for them. He was the guy who turned it around at Dortmund. 'The whole situation there - he built the squad on young players and they improved so much in the seven years he was in charge. It is a sad situation. 'But in the summer, it will be a new situation for him. Maybe he is going to go abroad and see how it goes there. 'I would love to see more German managers abroad, because it is obviously a new challenge, to adapt to the culture, the language, the system. Yes, why not? 'It is his decision. He worked really hard and pushed really hard, so even if he said he is not tired, maybe he takes a bit of breather to fuel his energy and his batteries? 'But I am curious what happened to him because he was an outstanding figure in the Bundesliga in the last couple of years and always a title contender. They went to the Champions League final. It will be interesting to see what happens in the summer.' Klopp has been tipped to replace Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger but it remains unlikely",

Charities last night welcomed the move to create a new generation of lifesavers, saying it could prevent hundreds of deaths every year. Previously, only the Liberal Democrats had promised to add the crucial lessons to the school curriculum. But last week Labour, Ukip and the Green Party added their support as they unveiled their Election manifestos. Three more political parties have backed The Mail on Sunday\u2019s campaign\u00a0to add first aid to the curriculum It means the Conservatives are the only major party not to make the same manifesto pledge. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham told The Mail on Sunday that the issue was \u2018close to his heart\u2019. He said: \u2018One of my constituents, a very fit 16-year-old called Daniel Young, collapsed and died on the football pitch ten years ago. It really touched me \u2013 as a parent, the trauma of losing a child in those circumstances is incomprehensible. \u2018Our manifesto pledge is about making sure all children are taught basic CPR skills before leaving school. We want to empower a generation of children, and potentially save hundreds of lives. This is about community resilience and people looking after each other.\u2019 Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham (pictured left) said the issue was \u2018close to his heart\u2019 The Mail on Sunday is campaigning to make sure all schools teach basic first-aid techniques. The skills can also be taught by older children to their younger peers. The campaign has support from Schools Minister David Laws, teachers, doctors and leading charities. Tory Education Secretary Nicky Morgan believes schools should not be forced to teach first-aid skills as part of an overcrowded curriculum However, Tory Education Secretary Nicky Morgan insists that while first-aid skills are important, schools should not be forced to teach them as part of an overcrowded curriculum.

St John Ambulance has launched a \u2018promise portal\u2019 to encourage all Election candidates to register their support for the campaign. Richard Fernandez, the charity\u2019s head of public affairs, said: \u2018We have been calling for first aid to be a compulsory part of the national curriculum, so that every child has the chance to learn to be a lifesaver. 'This is a policy that has had backing from individuals in all parties, but it has yet to become reality. \u2018We\u2019re delighted that Labour, the Liberal Democrats, Ukip and the Greens have now adopted this policy and included it in their General Election manifestos.

Whether it is Crocs, hotpants or UGG boots, everyone has their Achilles heel and this summer many will be concerned about the arrival of the septum piercing. In recent months, a whole host of stars have been wearing the body jewellery, including FKA Twigs, Rihanna and Lady Gaga. FKA Twigs has been one of the main trendsetters when it comes to the septum ring The septum ring isn't a new trend - the process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils has been done for years. It was a coming-of-age ritual for some North American tribes - the boys would be given the nose ring when they became a man, the Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa both had them. In certain warrior tribes, it was used in a similar way to war paint - to look terrifying in front of opponents. In Australia, Aboriginals used the piercing to try and flatten their nose, which they believed made them look more attractive. Lady Gaga (left) and Lourdes Leon (right) have both adopted the trend It girl Pixie Geldof wears a simple silver septum ring Rihanna wears an outlandish septum ring and offsets the look with a 90s bucket hat In India, and Bangladesh septum piercings are still very popular with women - many Bengali women wear it to show they are married, although this practice is being increasingly replaced with a nose stud. In Nepal, it is often used as a status symbol. The septum ring, which is also known\u00a0as the 'bull-ring piercing,' is also used as a way of controlling and handling bulls. But in the UK, America and Australia, it is mainly used as a fashion trend and to create a hippy or rebellious look.

In Aintree's crowded unsaddling area, the former England captain was making a beeline to the place marked with a big number '3', with his wife, Zara Phillips, scampering in hot pursuit. Not even a hug from AP McCoy could check his momentum. No wonder. Tindall was beaming from ear-to-ear having just seen Monbeg Dude, the horse whom he owns with James Simpson-Daniel and Nicky Robinson, run his heart out and wanted to be in place for when the old warrior, who was sent off unconsidered at 40/1, returned. Former England rugby captain Mike Tindall and wife Zara Philipps at Aintree ahead of the Grand National Tindall celebrates after watching his horse\u00a0Monbeg Dude finish third in the National Monbeg Dude is now 10 and, according to his jockey Liam Treadwell, 'likes to do things at his own pace' but his resolution is not in question and this was the latest wonderful day he had given his owners and trainer Michael Scudamore. Think about this for a CV: a Welsh Grand National in January 2013, victory in a big chase at Cheltenham in December of the same year and being placed in a Hennessey Gold Cup at Newbury last November, then this. Not bad for a horse that cost \u00a312,000. While the exultant connections of winner Many Clouds were celebrating a few yards away, their joy was almost matched by the happiness of the Monbeg Dude team; as Michael shook his head in wonder, his father Peter, the former champion jump jockey, dashed to engulf him in a bear hug. Here was thumping evidence that no other race stirs the emotions quite like the Crabbie's Grand National. The \u00a388,400 was by far the biggest pot Monbeg Dude has collected in his 24-race career but the reactions of Tindal et al (ITALICISE) showed this was about far more than money. 'Pride is the word I would use,' said Michael Scudamore. 'I am so happy for the horse. He is unbelievably tough and brave. To put in a performance like that after coming here last year (finishing seventh), I am just so proud. The owners are buzzing, so is the jockey.' Many Clouds and Aspell jump a fence on the way to winning the 2015 Grand National at Aintree Treadwell's contented look as he strolled to the Owners and Trainers tent a little while after said as much. He won the Grand National in 2009, when steering Mon Mome to a 100/1 success, but this was the first time he had ridden in the race since 2010, when unseating at the 20th from Nozic. 'I am absolutely delighted,' said Treadwell. 'The horse didn't even know he had been in a race. He got hampered at Becher's Brook the first time and that checked his momentum but he has given me a fantastic ride. 'Last year he looked like he was going to be the winner going to the last and there was a point when I thought my run was going to take me there this time but he just flattened out a bit at The Elbow. But what a great day. I really appreciate everything about this atmosphere now.' He wasn't the only one. Aintree, even when you are defeated, is a place where dreams can come true.",

And while it was a good day Woods, the golfing great still had some stressful moments and still has a way to go in catching up to leader, 21-year-old Jordan Spieth. Heading into the weekend he is a very, very distant 12 strokes behind a seemingly unstoppable Spieth, with 36 holes left to play. Scroll down for video Lindsey Vonn was back at Augusta Friday to watch boyfriend Tiger Woods (above) play in the second round of the Masters Vonn (above) looked stressed at times though Woods played a solid round, carding a three-under-par 69 Woods is still well behind the leader, hot young American star Jordan Spieth (above) This as\u00a0Woods, competing after a two-month absence to retool his game, showed flashes of his old magic as he fired his best score at the Masters in four years in Friday's second round. The former world number one has been under intense scrutiny after struggling badly with his chipping when last seen on the PGA Tour but he played solidly at steamy Augusta National to card a three-under-par 69. That left Woods at two-under 142, far behind the pacesetting American Spieth, but still delighted to be in contention after working hard to resurrect his game. If Spieth wins he would tie the record for the youngest winner in Masters history with Woods This was Vonn's second day in a row cheering on Woods 'I'm still right there,' 14-time major winner Woods said of his position going into the weekend 'I was at a pretty low one (point) in my career,' Woods said after mixing four birdies with a bogey to climb into a tie for 14th when he ended his round. 'To basically change an entire (swing) pattern like that and put it together, put it in a position where I can compete in a major championship like this is something I'm very proud of.' Woods, who plunged to 111th in the rankings as he struggled to return to form following back surgery last year and his fifth swing change, again struggled with the pace of Augusta National's heavily contoured greens. 'I had a hard time getting the ball close to the hole,' said Woods. 'You expect certain putts to roll out, but they're not rolling out.' Watched by huge galleries, Woods made a fast start, hitting a superb approach to seven feet at the par-four first and rolling in the birdie putt as shouts of 'Watch out, Tiger's back' and 'Come on Tiger, let's go' rang out. Spieth, 21, broke the 36 hole record on Friday and is 14-under-par for the tournament, 12 strokes ahead of Woods His only bogey came at the par-three sixth, his tee shot ending up just off the back of the green from where he had 45 feet to the flag but hit a weak chip that advanced just 20 feet. Woods immediately rebounded in birdie-birdie style, draining a 25-footer at the tricky seventh and hitting his third shot at the par-five eighth to two feet. He birdied the 11th after conjuring a moment of magic from the pine straw to the right of the fairway, a soaring approach settling 12 feet from the cup. 'I'm still right there,' the 14-time major winner said of his position going into the weekend. 'I'm 12 back, but there's not a lot of guys ahead of me. And with 36 holes here to go, anything can happen.'",

        "context": "A new sexual technique that aims to teach women how to 'expand the sweet spot' experienced during orgasm has swept into the UK. Orgasmic meditation, shortened to OM, is a practice that marries sex with mindfulness and, according to its founders, encourages 'connection, vitality and wellness' and 'cultivates a greater connection' between partners. The practice, which was founded by US entrepreneur Nicole Daedone, borrows much of its philosophy from yoga and meditation. Director of OneTaste, Justine Dawson (seated on the sofa), is shown guiding a couple through orgasmic meditation, which\u00a0aims to teach couples how to enable women to orgasm more deeply Orgasmic meditation involves the light stimulation of a woman's clitoris for 15 minutes without interruption According to teachers of OM, it involves the light stimulation of a woman's clitoris for 15 minutes without interruption. The aim is not necessarily to orgasm but simply to 'feel' the sensation as intensely as possible. Usually practiced in pairs, there is a 'strokee' and a 'stroker'.\u00a0OM-ing affects the same parts of the human brain as conventional meditation. Daedone first taught orgasmic meditation in the US in 2001 and since then the craze has spread around the world.\u00a0There are currently over 10,000 practitioners worldwide and 2,000 in the UK alone. There are also 30 dedicated orgasmic meditation centres across the globe. OM can be led in classes or with an individual trainer, if those attending desire a more private setting.\u00a0In the classes, which cost \u00a3195 for a seven-hour session, attendees can be couples or singles. The director of the US company OneTaste, which has brought the sessions to the UK via affiliate company TurnON Britain, says the demographic on classes are surprisingly mixed. Justine Dawson told FEMAIL: 'All kinds of people come to the courses - people in their 20s through their 70s and even into their 80s. She continues: '[It's a mixture of] Singles and couples. Some couples who have been together for a year, others for 30 years. There are all kinds of professional backgrounds - doctors, teachers, programmers, managers, artists, therapists. 'I would say that most people are 25-55, 70 per cent are single, 30 per cent are couples. All who come share a common desire to experience greater connection in their lives.' Your average Brit might find the thought of disrobing in front of others for such an intimate encounter mortifying but Dawson believes that most people can get over the embarrassment if they feel they're gaining a valuable experience. She says: 'When it comes to discussions of orgasm, relationship and connection, I believe that most people are shy. 'But people come to the class regardless, because they know that good things take practice and just like your health or career, it's worth putting time and effort into your sex and relationships, even if it means being a little uncomfortable!' The aim of the \u00a3195 class is to help women prolong the 'sweet spot' when orgasming. There are currently\u00a02,000 people  practicing the method in the UK, according to Turn On Britain Director of US company OneTaste, Justine Dawson, says her aspirations for the practice are that it becomes second nature to mention OM alongside yoga and meditation A video from a private class in London, led by Justine Dawson, shows a woman lying on a towel with a pillow behind her head. She is naked from the waist down and a partner sits on the floor by her side. Dawson, who's been teaching OM for eight years, explains: 'It's a 15 minute partner practice that two people can do together to increase connection, vitality, wellness and to cultivate a greater connection between them. 'A woman takes off her pants and lies down. Her partner sits next to her and lightly and deliberately strokes her clitoris for 15 minutes.' Dawson thinks the attraction for OM is that it offers a more conscious approach to sex and relationships. 'I believe there is a growing trend for the practice because our culture as a whole is ready for something different than the sex and relationships that have been \"on the menu\" up until now. She adds: 'We're ready for a different approach. One that is more conscious. People want information on how to do that. And we offer it openly.' Dawson also leads a team of teachers, holding monthly public sessions of up to 50 people in which couples are shown a demonstration, and then can partake themselves. She says she became an OM teacher out of personal interest: 'As someone who had practiced meditation for many years, I was looking for a wellness practice that would enhance my connection with a partner, while deepening my connection to myself. 'As many wellness practices are done in silence or even solitude, I was curious for one that instead could be done in connection, in a way that would enliven my relationships. I started with a class and it turned into my career, much to my surprise.' She hopes that one day OM will be mentioned in the same breath as yoga or meditation, saying: 'Our vision is that people could equally say yoga, meditation, orgasmic meditation.' Orgasmic meditation founder Nicole Daedone hails from California. Before focusing her attentions on orgasmic meditation, the author and entrepreneur was a University Instructor in Semantics and Gender Communication. Daedone first taught orgasmic meditation in the USA in 2001 and since then the craze has spread around the world. There are currently over 10,000 practitioners worldwide and 2,000 in the UK alone. Vanity Fair named Daedone in its list of 'Twelve Women Who Changed the Way We Look at Sex' and around 900,000 people have viewed her  Ted talk, entitled Orgasm, the Cure for Hunger in Western Woman.",

        "context": "We are all guilty of taking the odd cheesy tourist photo, be it trying to push the Leaning Tower of Pisa, or 'touch' the top of a pyramid. One traveller in particular knows how wrong a holiday snap can go, after he posted a picture online of him 'missing' the top of the Eiffel Tower and asked users to help improve his photo. On a recent trip to Paris, Belgian food blogger Yves Van De Ven enjoyed poking fun at those tourist clich\u00e9s and took a couple of pictures deliberately missing some of the more famous monuments. Little did he know he would become an internet sensation, after his photo with the Eiffel Tower captioned 'nailed it' was uploaded to photosharing website 4chan. Since then over 100 photoshopped pictures have sprung up comically connecting his finger with the tip of the famous attraction, and it didn't stop there... Nailed it!\u00a0Yves Van De Ven, 37, uploaded this photograph on social media in a bid to poke fun of the typical tourist pictures Going viral! An upload on photo-sharing site 4chan requested users connect his finger with the top of the tower, as many tourist pictures aim to achieve The 37-year-old said he thought it would be hilarious to deliberately make fun of the typical pictures with famous landmarks. 'The original pictures in which me and my friends 'nailed it' were an instant hit with my friends as soon as I posted them on Facebook,' Van De Ven said. 'There were people that thought we just took poor pictures but luckily most of my friends know better.' Obviously the internet had something to say about the pictures and after someone uploaded the pictures to 4chan, users from all over the globe submitted their own 'improved' versions of Van De Ven's pictures. Created images ranged from the comical, with the 301m tower bent over to touch his outstretched finger, to the absurd, with Van De Ven imposed into Michaelango's Creation of Adam, reaching out towards the Eiffel Tower. The wondrous offerings demonstrate what a brilliant place the internet is, and how no one's holiday pictures are safe. Bendy tower! The tower appears to have flopped over in the summer heat, making a connection with the food blogger's finger Cut out! Despite covering the 37-year-old, his finger is clearly in contact in this picture! Expert photoshopping creates a miniature tower touching his finger, never mind about the gaping white hole left behind! Close enough! Tilting the tower 45 degrees, and extending his arm in an octopus fashion were methods used to 'improve' the picture Super hero! In a Hulk-like fashion, not only has\u00a0Van De Ven knocked over the Eiffel Tower, but also has it grasped in two fingers Van De Ven is shocked but highly entertained at the widespread response to his holiday pictures. 'I can honestly say that we have had as much fun taking these silly pictures as we have had the week after overviewing the hilarious aftermath. 'Some of the photoshopped pictures are just brilliant.' Eiffel Tower touches\u00a0Van De Ven! This photo plays on role reversal with the tower spectacularly missing touching him Basically there! A longer arm is all it takes to recreate the popular tourist pose If in doubt, enlarge the poser (left), or do as most people do and stand closer to the camera! Or why not create more failed fingers (right) to add to the picture? Why not just duplicate the offending failed finger all over the Eiffel Tower? (Still without it making contact!) See double! That works! Not only does he touch the top, he does it twice in this picture A portal has allowed the tip of the tower to protrude near the blogger's feet so he can touch the tip Why not ignore the failed hand all together, and just reposition it on top? Job done! (left) Or why not reverse the original photograph? (right) So elegant! The original pose has been imposed on a ballerina dancing on a studio Another wondrous offering from the internet shows him expertly defending a basketball hoop The internet wins again!\u00a0Van De Ven (as God) reaching out for the Eiffel Tower (as man) in Michelangelo's famous painting,\u00a0The Creation of Adam Bullrilliant!\u00a0Van De Ven becomes a matador unperturbed by a bull with horns consisting of the Eiffel Tower",

        "context": "A 78-year-old Connecticut man with a long criminal history was arrested on Friday, but the man's lawyer claimed the arrest was a ruse intended to pressure him to talk about the biggest art heist in U.S. history. Robert Gentile appeared in federal court in Hartford, Connecticut, on Friday and was charged with selling a firearm to an undercover agent. His attorney, Ryan McGuigan, contended Federal Bureau of Investigation agents really want to see what Gentile knows about the theft of $500million in artwork from Boston's Isabel Stewart Gardner Museum 25 years ago. Scroll down for video Robert Gentile's attorney Ryan McGuigan (pictured), said that though his client was arrested on a gun charge, he believes the arrest was a ruse to pressure Gentile to speak about the $500million art heist from 1990 A security guard at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner museum stands outside the room from which most of the paintings were pilfered the day after the massive heist This FBI sketch shows a likeness of the two suspects, who were reportedly wearing police uniforms when they performed the theft. They have have never been caught 'The FBI has been questioning him for years because they think he knows the whereabouts of the Gardner paintings,' McGuigan said. He added: 'But he's being set up, just like others who are threatened with long periods of incarceration by the FBI in the Gardner case. 'The gun charge is just an excuse to question and threaten him further.' Police previously identified three suspects in the theft: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. Merlino and Guarente have died. Gentile has denied any knowledge of the heist and the missing work. The thieves stole two Rembrandts - The Storm on the Sea of Galilee (left), believed to be the only seascape the master painted, and A Lady and Gentleman in Black.\u00a0Jan Vermeer's The Concert (right) was also stolen and is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter Chez Tortoni, painted by Manet, shows a man wearing a top hat at a jaunty angle; it was one of the last paintings to be stolen from the museum Govaert Flinck's 'Landscape with an Obelisk,' painted in 1638, was originally attributed to Rembrandt, but was later found to be the work of his assistant, Flinck The FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office in Connecticut declined to comment on McGuigan's claim. The Gardner heist took place on the rainy night of March 18, 1990, when two men posing as police officers arrived at the museum's front door. The guards on duty let them in and the pair allegedly overpowered them, one of whom spoke earlier this year about his guilt of letting the men in. The next morning the guards were found duct-taped to chairs in the basement and 13 artworks including Rembrandt van Rijn's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Johannes Vermeer's 'The Concert' were missing. A Degas sketch from 1884 (left) and a self-portrait of Rembrandt (right) were also among the items stolen from the museum The empty frames from Rembrandt's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Vermeer's 'The Concert' remain on display in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces Left, a visitor looks at the empty frame from a Rembrandt work, and right, the museum pictured in 1990 following the heist, the empty frame of Rembrandt's oil painting 'A Lady and Gentleman in Black' lies on the floor and a space on the wall remains bare where his 'The Storm on the Sea of Galilee' once hung In total the haul including three Rembrandt works, five sketches by Edgar Degas, an \u00c9douard Manet painting and a painting by Vermeer - one of only 36 in the world. A bronze eagle statue, a Chinese beaker from 1100 BC and a painting by Govaert Flinck were also taken. Due to a quirk in the museum founder's will, the empty frames that once held those paintings remain on the walls, an ever-present reminder of one of Boston longest-unsolved crimes. Aside from two sketches of mustachioed men in police hats - one with glasses and one without - little detail has ever been given as to who the thieves may have been. The FBI identified three persons of interest in the Gardner case, all with ties to organized crime: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. In 2012 Robert Gentile's Connecticut home and shed (pictured) was searched by the FBI in connection with the case gents used radar, as well as two beagles and a ferret, to dig up parts of Gentile's front lawn in 2012; the FBI warrant allowed the use of ground-penetrating radar FBI investigators have long said they believed organized crime groups were behind the heist. Gentile in 2012 submitted to a lie detector test that showed a high likelihood that he had lied when he investigators asked if he had any knowledge of the heist, according to court testimony. A 2012 FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as police uniforms. Gentile has a criminal record dating back to the 1950s. Most recently he spent two years in prison after being convicted of illegally selling prescription drugs to an informant. The gun charge he currently faces could carry a ten-year prison charge if he is convicted due to his status as a felon. The FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as policeuniforms The FBI, pictured here in 2013, has actively offered a $5million reward to anyone who had information that led to the painting's safe return to the museum",

Chris Roberts, who featured in a string of Fox News reports, was yanked off his plane after it landed in Syracuse, New York, on Wednesday night by two FBI agents and two uniformed officers. Roberts, who works for security intelligence company One World Labs, was questioned for the next four hours. Scroll down for video Chris Roberts of One World Labs was grabbed after his plane landed in Syracuse, New York, on Wednesday Roberts has been featured on the Fox News television show On the Record with Greta Van Susteren (left) The FBI agents took electronic devices and computer files from Roberts and confiscated his laptop and thumb drives,\u00a0Fox News\u00a0reported. They asked to forensically image his laptop, but Roberts told the agents to get a warrant. He was coming to town to speak at\u00a0an aerospace conference about vulnerabilities in airplane systems and did make a presentation at the event on Thursday without the use of his electronics. The incident occurred only a few hours after\u00a0a report about Roberts' research was released by Fox. Roberts said in the report: 'We can still take planes out of the sky thanks to the flaws in the in-flight entertainment systems. 'Quite simply put, we can theorize on how to turn the engines off at 35,000 feet and not have any of those damn flashing lights go off in the cockpit.' Experts worry planes' flight and entertainment systems could be compromised by terrorist hacking (file photo) The Government Accountability Office released a report earlier this week with similar findings. The GAO report stated: 'According to cybersecurity experts we interviewed, Internet connectivity in the cabin should be considered a direct link between the aircraft and the outside world, which includes potential malicious actors.' Roberts is scheduled to fly home Friday and is already pre-checked through the TSA. He said: 'You have one element in the FBI reaching out to people like me for help, but another element doing a hell of a job burning those bridges. 'Those of us who do threat research are doing it for the right reasons, and we work to build relationships with the intelligence community because we want to help them identify weaknesses before they become a problem.'",

The 22-year-old, from Melbourne, was jogging along a street in the rural southern Oklahoma city of Duncan in August 2013, when he was shot in the back with a .22 calibre handgun. His parents, Donna and Peter Lane listened to the frantic seven-minute 911 emergency phone call made by Oklahoma resident who witnessed their son collapsed on the side of the road. Chancey Luna, 17, was charged with  first-degree murder. The teen was riding in a Ford Focus with two teenage friends when he allegedly pulled the trigger as the vehicle drove past. Scroll down for video Family and friends, along with his then girlfriend Sarah Harper (right) broke down as they listened to the frantic seven-minute 911 emergency call made by witnesses who tried to save Chris Lane's (left) life Joy Smith: He's turning blue. 9-11 dispatch: Is he talking to you right now? Joy Smith: No he's [gasping noise], that's all he's doing, making that noise. 9-11: All right, you just stay on the line with me, OK? Joy Smith: If you don't hurry, he's gone. 9-11: Ma'am, they're coming OK, I can't make them come any faster. Joy Smith: Oh my gosh how long's it going to be? He's stopped breathing. Mr Lane, who was on a baseball scholarship with Oklahoma's East Central University, was visiting his girlfriend in Duncan when he was randomly gunned down. Family and friends, including Mr Lane's former girlfriend Sarah Harper, heard details about how two bystanders tried to resuscitate the young man who had stopped breathing and wept during the proceedings at the Duncan's District Court on Wednesday. Members of the family broke into loud, uncontrolled sobs when authorities showed the white baseball cap Lane wore when he was shot and photographs of the bullet wound taken in a hospital morgue. Linda Prior cried as she told court how she attempted to shut Lane's 'big brown eyes' but wasn't able to after failing to resuscitate him. 'The big brown eyes were just staring at me,' Ms Prior, who has first aid training and performed CPR, told the court.

Another local, Richard Rhoades, who also tried to help Lane, said he took off his shirt to place it over Lane's face when they realised he was dead. 'I just thought it would be nice to close his eyes,' he said. Luna's lawyer, Jim Berry, made a shock admission in court on Tuesday that his client had fired the bullet that killed Lane but added the teen was 'reckless' and was only trying to 'scare the jogger'. The lawyer told the jury that for Luna to be found guilty of first degree murder, the prosecution would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt the murder was premeditated.

        "context": "(CNN)Two Transportation Security Administration screeners have been fired after conspiring to grope attractive men at Denver International Airport, Denver police said. Here's how police say the scheme worked: When the male TSA officer noticed a man he found attractive, he would alert a female TSA officer. The female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through. And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation. But during the patdown, the male TSA officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger's front groin area and buttocks, which violates TSA policy. Former TSA agent sentenced for recording coworker All this came to light after an anonymous tip from a TSA employee in November. The agency launched an investigation, and investigator Chris Higgins monitored the two TSA officers in question, Denver police said in a report. Higgins watched the plan being carried out on February 9. He interviewed the female TSA officer, who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times, police said. Both of the TSA officers investigated have been fired, TSA special agent Charles Stone told police. Authorities did not release their names. Giant security gap at airports: Lack of criminal background checks The TSA called the incident deplorable. \"These alleged acts are egregious and intolerable,\" the agency said in a written statement to CNN. \"All allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated by the agency. And when substantiated, employees are held accountable.\" But it's unlikely criminal charges will be filed because there is no identifiable victim. The TSA said it has been trying to identify the passenger in the February incident but to no avail. The TSA said no passengers have come forward with similar cases so far at the Denver airport. Hidden cameras reveal airport workers stealing from luggage CNN's Tony Marco contributed to this report.",

        "context": "Jonjo O'Neill hosted a media stable visit on Thursday at his Jackdaws Castle yard in Gloucestershire and said he could not be happier with favourite for the Crabbie's Grand National, Shutthefrontdoor. He trains Shutthefrontdoor for his principal patron J P McManus, who owns Jackdaws Castle and retains AP McCoy, the record-breaking Jump jockey who is about to gain his 20th consecutive jockeys' championship and retire. McCoy has not decided yet whether he is riding Shutthefrontdoor in the \u00a31million Crabbie's Grand National at Aintree on  April 11, but everything points to him doing so. Jonjo O'Neill hopes jockey AP McCoy rides\u00a0Shutthefrontdoor to Grand National success later this month O'Neill told Betfred: 'Shutthefrontdoor is in great form. I could not be happier with him. I would have liked to have got a run into him (before the Grand National) but he had an abscess on his sinus in January/February time which took a while to find out where it was. 'We did think about giving him at run at Cheltenham (at the Festival in March) but decided not to. I think he is a better horse on a flat track and secondly I did not want to give him a hard race at a time when he wasn't as well as he is now. He is schooling well and is spot on. 'He is a clean-winded horse, who is not hard to get ready. He was ready to run and win first time out at Carlisle. He is going to Aintree fresh and well. It is all down to AP now if he is going ride him. 'You need to have a good classy horse for the National. Before, you needed a good jumper and a lot of luck, now it is a proper race. Aintree has done a great job with the track and the fences are first class. 'He likes to be up there and hopefully in the first half of the runners - that at least is my plan. If he got luck in running over the first mile, I would ride him myself. 'I don't bet so it does not make any difference to me what price he is - I am just training the horse as though he was going for a little race at Stratford or whatever! This year's Grand National will be McCoy's last-ever at Aintree before his retirement at the end of the season 'Hopefully, AP is going to ride Shutthefrontdoor and the public will want to back him, looking for a fairytale story. We would all love that to happen, but it is a tall order. 'The only pressure (on me) is that Shutthefrontdoor gets there safe and sound. He is in the best form I can possibly get him. I would be more nervous if we had hiccups now but we had them in January and February. If he doesn't win, we can blame whoever rides him! 'I'd love good ground at Aintree - he is a well-balanced horse and a great mover. He does not want it too soft. Perfect jumping ground is ideal. They make a good job of the ground at Aintree - we just don't want the heavens to open. He is as good as any horse in the National. 'We are going there full of confidence, but you have got to be realistic - it is the National.' Don't Push It gave O'Neill, McManus and McCoy their first Grand National victory in 2010. O'Neill continued: 'This preparation has gone better than Don't Push It's. Don't Push It was a bit of a law unto himself. Alan Berry has done all the work with this horse, like he did with Don't Push It. We think we have got it all right and are very happy with the way things have gone. Shutthefrontdoor, pictured with O'Neill (right) is the favourite for the race on April 11 'Shutthefrontdoor is a lovely horse - a real old pet - and loves racing, while the other horse was half-mad, a character. 'He lacks experience as a jumper but I think he is quite clever, pretty accurate and knows what he is doing. If he does take to the fences, he will run a blinder. 'I have taken him away (to racecourses) a couple of times so he is not too fresh. I don't want him to be too fresh over the first couple of fences. I used to build three or four National fences every year but one year we didn't and that was the year Don't Push It won so we haven't since. The Grand National fences are now really inviting. 'The Grand National grips you and is magic to be involved in. 'We will miss AP not riding in races next season but hopefully he is still going to be involved. We are not going to let him off the hook that easily - we may drag him in for schooling.' O'Neill envisages a team of between eight and 12 running at Aintree during the three days of the Crabbie's Grand National Festival (April 9 - 11).

They fell short in the title race last season and then faltered in the last four of the Capital One Cup in January, but Rodgers thinks they are ready to progress. Reds have captain Steven Gerrard (centre) back for their FA Cup semi after serving a three-match suspension \u2018When you get so close, whether it was in the title race or the cup, it hurts,\u2019 said Rodgers. \u2018Trace back the winners in sport. If you look at everything they have won, also look at what they have lost. You will see that they go close on a number of occasions before they step on. \u2018Look at players who have won Champions Leagues and you trace back and see they have also lost Champions League semi-finals and finals.

        "context": "Chris Christie's wife has quit her big-money job on Wall Street in what could be a sign her husband has decided to run for president in 2016. May Pat Christie, 51, a managing director at New York City finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co, ditched her $475,000-a-year position this week, a family spokesman confirmed. The official reason for the resignation was 'to spend more time with her family and young children'. But many will see the move as a sign that New Jersey governor Christie, 52, is coming closer to seeking the Republican nomination for the 2016 presidential election. Scroll down for video Ditching Wall Street: Mary Pat Christie, right, has quit her $475,000-a-year position at finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co According to Fox Business, she had previously told colleagues that her leaving would be a precursor to her husband's run. She is often seen out on the campaign trail with Christie, making a recent appearance in New Hampshire - a necessary stop for would-be presidents. Earlier this month the Christies said they were undecided about what Mary Pat should do with her job, and seemed to downplay the chances of her quitting. Christie said then that leaving a career would be 'a big sacrifice for a spouse to make', and that it also 'wouldn't be a requirement', even if he did run for president. More of this? The move is likely a precursor to Christie's bid for president - which would entail a lot of campaigning from Mrs Christie, pictured above with her husband in New Hampshire Her decision mirrors that of another Wall Street Republican spouse - Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi. Mrs Cruz, whose husband was the first to launch his presidential campaign, immediately took unpaid leave from her high-powered position at Goldman Sachs, and will stay away from the office for the duration of his campaign. Mrs Christie's departure from her job will mean a major dip in the Christies' income. The family's latest tax returns, from 2013, revealed that she brought in the lion's share of the family's earnings. Not the breadwinner: Christie's family tax returns show that his wife earns almost three times as much as him She reported a $510,000 total salary, made up of the $475,000 managing director's pay packet and around $35,000 from a side job as a bond trader. In the same year Christie's gubernatorial salary was $175,000. However, during his visit to a New Hampshire newspaper's editorial board he insisted his family is 'not wealthy by current standards' when complaining about the complexity of his tax return. He later tried to clarify his comments by saying 'we have four children to raise and a lot of things to do' - but many pointed out that he still easily sits in the wealthiest 1 per cent of his home state.",

Jamie Silvonek was charged as an adult with homicide and criminal conspiracy, Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin announced Thursday. Cheryl Silvonek, 54, was fatally stabbed in the driveway of her Upper Macungie Township home early March 15, hours after taking Jamie Silvonek and the eighth-grader's boyfriend, Army Spc. Caleb Barnes, to a concert, according to court documents. Scroll down for video Star-crossed lovers: Jamie Silvonek (left), 14, and her boyfriend, 20-year-old Army Spc Caleb Barnes (right), have been charged with killing the girl's mother for trying to break them up Barnes, who was on leave from Fort Meade in Maryland at the time of the slaying, was previously charged with homicide. He confessed to stabbing Cheryl Silvonek in the neck multiple times while they were in Silvonek's car, and Jamie Silvonek admitted she was there when he did it and helped dispose of the body, according to an affidavit of probable cause. Slain in cold blood: Cheryl Silvonek, 54, was stabbed several times in the neck inside her car after driving her daughter and Barnes from a concert The teen's attorney, John Waldron, said Thursday he believes his client was under Barnes' control, given the age disparity. 'There has to be some type of duress or coercion,' he said. Waldron said he intends to have Jamie Silvonek examined by a forensic psychologist and will petition to have the case moved to juvenile court. 'She cried incessantly and told me how much she missed her mom, and told me she was coerced, she was afraid she was going to be killed, she was afraid her dad was going to be killed,' Waldron told The Associated Press. 'So there's a lot of things we have to decipher here.' Authorities said Barnes and Jamie Silvonek met in October \u2014 when she was 13 \u2014 but that she told him she was 17.\u00a0He joined the military in February of 2012. Barnes graduated advanced training from the Presidio of Monterey, California, and his awards include the Good Conduct Medal and National Defense Service Medal, Army Times reported. Cheryl Silvonek found out about their relationship in early March and ordered the couple to break up, according to court documents. A day later, the teenager told Barnes she wanted her parents dead, the documents said. On March 14, Cheryl Silvonek learned that Barnes intended to take her daughter to a concert in Scranton. 'He is not coming to this house,' Cheryl Silvonek texted to her daughter, who had taken the SAT college entrance exam that morning, according to a police affidavit. Police found the victim's blood-soaked car submerged in a pond and traced it to the Silvonek family's home in\u00a0Upper Macungie Township (pictured) Silvonek's attorney said the girl tearfully told him she missed her mother, and claimed she was coerced by her soldier boyfriend and afraid for her life The eighth-grader sent her mother a text in response begging her to let them go. 'Mom, if I can't go I'm going to have a mental breakdown,' she said, according to the affidavit. 'I need to go and I need to be with my friends. I feel so desolate mother.' The teenager then texted Barnes: 'She threatened to throw me out of the house. I want her gone,' the affidavit said. Later, she allegedly wrote to him: 'Just do it.' Records show the 14-year-old was upset that her mother had shown her boyfriend her passport as proof that Silvonek was not 17. 'I can't stand her lying to you like this,' Jamie wrote to Barnes. 'SHE IS LYING ABOUT MY AGE,' reported Lehigh Valley Live. Cheryl Silvonek agreed to drive her daughter and Barnes to the show. On their way, the teenager and her boyfriend continued exchanging messages. 'I love you. We can do this. We'll just drive her car then, right?' Jamie wrote, the affidavit said. Barnes replied in a text, 'No. That leaves us as the suspects.' The three drove back to the Silvonek home after the show, and Barnes allegedly stabbed Cheryl Silvonek. The couple then ate at a restaurant and went to Walmart to buy gloves, bleach and other cleaning supplies, authorities said. Lies: Barnes and Jamie Silvonek met in October \u2014 when she was 13 \u2014 but that she told him she was 17 Police found the body in a shallow grave a few miles from the Silvonek home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby. Investigators were able to trace the car back to the Silvonek home. When they arrived, they found Barnes, the girl and Silvonek's husband, David. The girl and Barnes were in an upstairs bedroom and the father was still asleep, CBS 13 reported. Barnes was previously charged with criminal homicide, abuse of a corpse and statutory sexual assault. There is evidence he had sex with the girl shortly before the killing, according to police. the 14-year-old was charged earlier with abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and hindering apprehension.",

And by 2060, immigrants could account for 82 per cent of all population growth in the country. One in seven U.S. residents will be an immigrant by 2023, the report from the Center for Immigration Studies\u00a0(CIS) said. Documented and undocumented immigrants in the United States could reach a record high in the United States by 2023, when their share of the population could hit 14.8 per cent That number could rise to one in five by 2060, when immigrant population reaches 78 million. This report comes as President Barack Obama is trying to use executive powers to expand\u00a0Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) policies. Net immigration will steadily increase over the next 45 years, totaling at 64million Without no change in current immigration policy, by 2023 the total immigrant population in the United states will reach 14.8 per cent, the highest ever recorded in American history Immigration population will grow almost four times faster than native-born population and will reach 15.8 per cent of the nation's population by 2030, 17.1 per cent by 2040 and 18.8 per cent by 2060 In 1990, immigrants accounted for just 7.9 per cent of U.S. population U.S population could grow to 417million by 2016. In 2010 the population was 306million Without a change to immigration policty, immigrants who arrive in the future and their descendants could account for three quarters of future U.S. population Center for Immigration Studies This could potentially exempt about five million undocumented immigrants from deportation. And with the surge in immigrant population, Republican presidential candidates have to figure out what their stance is on the subject as potential new policies could be established. CIS director of research Steven Camarota said that the growth in immigrant population has 'important implications for workers, schools, infrastructure, congestion and the environment'. 'They also may have implications for our ability to successfully assimilate and integrate immigrants,' he added. 'Yet there has been almost no national debate about bringing in so many people legally each year, which is the primary factor driving these numbers.' Currently there are approximately 12million undocumented immigrants in the United States and 70,000 more are expected to cross the border this year, according to the Washington Examiner. There are also more than 4.4million people on a U.S. State Department green card waiting list. And within years, Immigration population will grow almost four times faster than native-born population. From a starting point of 2010, immigration population will reach 15.8 per cent (57million) of the nation's population by 2030, 17.1 (65million) per cent by 2040 and 18.8 per cent (78million) \u00a0by 2060. Immigrants and their descendants will account for 75.5 per cent of the nation's population growth between 2010 and 2050 and 82 per cent of growth between 2010 and 2060. By 2060, immigrants and their descendants will account for 82 per cent of the nation's population growth since 2010 President Barack Obama is trying to use executive powers to expand immigration policies, which\u00a0could potentially exempt about 5million undocumented immigrants from deportation Alabama Rep. Sen. Jeff Sessions, who has been a leader in the immigration debate, said in a letter to the New York Times on Saturday that an increase of immigrants in the country will hurt the middle class. He wrote: 'It defies reason to argue that the record admission of new foreign workers has no negative effect on the wages of American workers, including the wages of past immigrants hoping to climb into the middle class. 'Why would many of the largest business groups in the United States spend millions lobbying for the admission of more foreign workers if such policies did not cut labor costs?' Key business leaders form a group association with former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are meeting on Friday to discuss expanding immigration. The meeting it titled 'Understanding and Improving the High-Skilled H-1B Visa Program', according to the examiner.

The six, whom authorities described as friends who met secretly to plan their travels, are accused of conspiracy to provide material support and attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. The complaint says the men planned to reach Syria by flying to nearby countries from Minneapolis, San Diego or New York City, and lied to federal investigators when they were stopped. Scroll down for video Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, and\u00a0Adnan Abdihamid Farah, both 19, and their four co-accused\u00a0have been described as close friends who met secretly to plan their travel to Syria Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19, and the five other men arrested have been accused of being 'intent' on joining ISIS Charged are Mohamed Abdihamid Farah, 21; Adnan Abdihamid Farah, 19; Abdurahman Yasin Daud, 21; Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, 19; Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19; and Guled Ali Omar, 20. 'These were focused men who were intent on joining a terrorist organization,' Minnesota U.S. Attorney Andy Luger said at a news conference Monday. The six were arrested Sunday in Minneapolis and San Diego and are scheduled to make initial appearances in federal court on Monday. They are the latest people from Minnesota to be charged in an investigation stretching back months into the recruitment of Westerners by IS. Authorities said earlier that a handful of Minnesota residents have traveled to Syria to fight with militants in the past year, and at least one has died. Three of those charged in the newest complaint - Mohamed Farah, Abdurahman and Musse - were stopped at a New York City airport in November along with 19-year-old Hamza Ahmed, but they were not charged until now. Ahmed was indicted on charges of lying to the FBI during a terrorism investigation, conspiring to provide material support to IS, and attempting to provide material support. He has pleaded not guilty. On Monday, the FBI announced the arrest of six Somali-American men from Minnesota, accused of trying to join ISIS. Above, FBI Special Agent Richard R Thornton details the arrests at a press conference, with U.S. Attorney Andrew M Luger to the left Despite being stopped already, Luger said, the three others continued to try to get to Syria to join IS 'by any means possible.' The complaint describes several interactions some of the men had with Abdi Nur, a Minnesota man charged previously with conspiracy to provide support to a terror organization. The complaint says Nur, 'from his locale in Syria, recruits individuals and provides assistance to those who want to leave Minnesota to fight abroad.' The complaint relies in part on material from a confidential informant who had himself conspired to join IS before he changed his mind and went to authorities. Some of the informant's conversations with the six men were recorded. The Minneapolis area is home to the largest concentration of Somali immigrants in the U.S. Since 2007, more than 22 young Somali men have also traveled from Minnesota to Somalia to join the militant group al-Shabab. Omar's older brother, Ahmed Ali Omar, was among those who joined al-Shabab, leaving Minnesota in December 2007, according to the complaint. Ahmed Omar remains a fugitive. It also said when agents went to the younger Omar's house after he was stopped in San Diego in November, another brother, Mohamed Ali Omar, threatened them.",

The breakdown in the relationship between the FA and England Supporters Travel Club led to the offensive chants during England\u2019s 1-1 draw with Italy in Turin on Tuesday.

Those with most caps get priority when buying tickets for big games. The Football Supporters Federation, despite putting out a statement yesterday reaffirming its opposition to abusive chanting, believe it is inevitable that the songs \u2014 and the World War Two favourites \u2014 will be sung when England play the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on June 7. There were offensive chants made by England fans during the game against Italy in Turin on Tuesday - there is no suggestion the fans pictured were involved England's next international is against Ireland and takes place in Dublin on June 7 The FSF are in no mood to work with the FA because of the caps dispute and claim that, having taken legal advice, anti-IRA and WW2 songs are not law-breaking and that the FA showed no interest when the FSF first tackled England fans singing offensive songs in 2005. The FA regard loyalty caps and abusive chanting as two separate issues.

The Premier League champions have written to 300 fans who took them up on their offer of free transport for the Bank Holiday evening clash at Selhurst Park. Palace's South London home is notoriously difficult to get to and the club acted after the game was scheduled for an 8pm start, making it impossible for supporters to travel by train. Edin Dzeko and his Manchester City team-mates reflect on their Premier League defeat at Crystal Palace Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany looks dejected after seeing his side slump to defeat in London However, after being sent on their way from the Etihad Stadium at 1.30pm by City legend Mike Summerbee, all of those onboard the six coaches missed the kick-off with some arriving as much as 20 minutes after the start. Some complained that Summerbee's send-off had gone on for too long and was responsible for their late arrival. Now, the club has acknowledged the coaches set off too late and have written to supporters to apologise and advise them that they will be refunding the cost of their match tickets. The letter, seen by Sportsmail, reads: 'The free coach travel was provided to enable supporters to attend this match on a day when return rail travel from Manchester wasn\u2019t an option due to the kick-off time, and the time of the final train back to Manchester.

'As a gesture to you and all supporters who travelled on the official coaches, the club will be refunding the money that you paid for your match ticket within the next seven working days. We will contact you if we require any further details to process the refund. 'We would like to apologise for the delayed arrival at Selhurst Park and thank you for your patience and support on the day.' The move is likely to cost the club in the region of \u00a312,000.

        "context": "A university undergraduate has claimed that the cost of trying to study in London left her with no other choice than to turn to prostitution. As renting in the capital soared to an average of more than \u00a31,100 per month, the second year history and politics student who attends a London university told how she took up sex work\u2013 even visiting some clients at their workplace. Speaking through the English Collective of Prostitutes', the woman \u2013 who asked to remain anonymous \u2013 spoke after a research project revealed more than a fifth of students have thought about being involved in the sex industry. A University student has revealed how she turned to sex work after her student loan failed to cover her rent (picture posed by model) The survey conducted by the University of Swansea further revealed that nearly five per cent of them had actually worked in the sex industry. The young woman said that she didn't immediately turn to prostitution but used it as a last resort after conventional means of work failed to support her. She said: 'I started working after my first year and tried various part time jobs: in a coffee shop, a pub and as a waitress. None paid enough. 'The student loan didn't cover even my housing, let alone living expenses, food, books and travel costs.' She added that money worries meant she began to struggle academically as well as financially. 'I had trouble keeping up with course work, especially if I worked evenings. 'For example at the pub, I'd earn \u00a37 an hour for an eight hour shift, two nights a week, so I'd bring home about \u00a3100 weekly. 'I'd just moved to London from the north of England. My family are not well off, so cannot afford to help me much. The student says that traditional means of earning failed to cover the cost of living in London 'I didn't know anyone in London so when I moved here it was starting from scratch.' Initially she lived in student accommodation in the city but says that working as a prostitute enabled her to afford somewhere better. 'It was an overcrowded, noisy flat with other students,' she said of her halls. She moved into her own home after she began to advertise her services. 'I could afford a place of my own. I advertise through a website and have regular clients. 'I visit them at home, in hotels and occasionally at their workplace.' Despite sex work not being an ideal situation the student says that it had been beneficial towards her studies. 'It is flexible and fits around my course. 'I can work the hours I want to and scale back around exam time or if I have extra course work.' The woman heard about sex work from other students who had also been looking for a way to earn extra money. 'In my first year at university I started hearing about students turning to sex work,' she said. 'After a time I met someone on another course who'd been working as a stripper in a bar. 'Through her I met another student doing escorting, she clued me in, said where to advertise, and how to avoid bad clients and work safely. 'She gave me the English Collective of Prostitutes' Rights sheet which tells about the laws and how they work. Although her new means of earning have enabled her to continue studying in London the woman says she does not particularly enjoy her work. 'My biggest worry is about being arrested because if I get a criminal record it would stay with me for life. It would be massive obstacle to getting other jobs.' However she remains adamant that this is the best option for her after seeing other friends trying alternative routes. 'Sex work is far batter paid and suits my time more than any other work I know of. 'Friends at university are working 10 hour shifts for under the minimum wage. Others are working on zero hour contracts and never know how many hours they will get. 'Sometimes they get none at all so it is very hard to budget and pay bills. 'I know students who've dropped out and left courses due to financial pressures.' However she is well aware of the risks she is taking and says she takes appropriate precautions to avoid being found out. 'Mostly students doing sex work don't talk about it. If it comes out, it could affect your future and job prospects.' The student's story may seem like a rare case but she says that it is become more regular practice in universities: 'Since I started escorting I've heard that a former roommate exchanged sex with her landlord to cover the rent. 'Another woman I know worked as a part time sex worker to earn enough to travel home to visit her family. 'Sex work among students is much more common than people think, and it is likely to increase as long as fees, rent and the cost of living is so high.'",

        "context": "(CNN)The last time Frank Jordan spoke with his son, Louis Jordan was fishing on a sailboat a few miles off the South Carolina coast. The next time he spoke with him, more than two months had passed and the younger Jordan was on a German-flagged container ship 200 miles from North Carolina, just rescued from his disabled boat. \"I thought I lost you,\" the relieved father said. Louis Jordan, 37, took his 35-foot sailboat out in late January and hadn't been heard from in 66 days when he was spotted Thursday afternoon by the Houston Express on his ship drifting in the Atlantic Ocean. \"I was utterly thankful and grateful to the people who rescued me, and I was grateful to God that my parents were not going to be worried about me,\" Jordan told CNN. Frank Jordan told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. And he had the strength to make it. \"He's got very strong constitution and (is strong) not only physically, but spiritually,\" Frank Jordan told CNN. \"And he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so I believe that sustained him a great deal.\" The younger Jordan said he took his sailboat out to the Gulf Stream to find some better fishing, when it capsized.  He broke his shoulder when the boat flipped. Because of the injury, Jordan couldn't repair the boat's mast, which had snapped. \"Everything I owned got broken -- all my electronics, my GPS devices,\" Jordan said.  He was dead in the water. Jordan drifted in the Atlantic, rationing food and water until his shoulder healed. He was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, Jordan said, but he could make little headway against the currents. \"It took so long,\" he said.  \"It moved so slowly.\" The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to Jordan. After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan.  The weather wouldn't cooperate. \"I had tried to collect (rain)water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat,\" Jordan said.  \"The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. \"Finally the conditions were right.  I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons.  I filled up a bucket.\" Then there was the issue of food. The fish weren't cooperating, but after a while Jordan learned that they were attracted to his laundry that he would put out to sea for a rinse. The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. Jodran came ashore Thursday evening. CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital at about 7:30 p.m. Jordan was reported missing January 29, a few days after his last contact with his father. Two months of concern poured out in a phone call with his son's rescuers. Frank Jordan thanked the captain of the Houston Express. \"You're a good man, I swear.  You did what you are supposed to do, and I sure do appreciate it,\" he says. \"And I know my son appreciates it.\" CNN's Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.",

        "context": "Actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus has revealed that the ultra-short hairstyle she models in the newest season of HBO's political comedy Veep was inspired by none other than presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Speaking in the latest issue of\u00a0Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, the 54-year-old, who stars as fictional US President Selina Meyer in the hit comedy show, was quick to note the scrutiny the former\u00a0senator\u00a0and secretary of state has faced as a result of her varying hairstyles over the years, while also leaping to the politician's defense. 'Hillary Clinton has gotten so much sh** for her hairstyles over the years,' Julia, who also features on the cover of the supplement, explained. 'Which is remarkable when you consider what it is she does.' Scroll down for video Strictly business: Julia Louis-Dreyfus covers Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, which is featured in the May issue of the magazine Short and sweet:\u00a0Julia revealed that the ultra-short hairstyle she models in the newest season of HBO's political comedy Veep (pictured) was inspired by none other than presidential candidate Hillary Clinton Obsessed with her style: Julia, pictured in an episode from the fourth season of Veep, questioned why so many people have made such a fuss over Hillary's hair during the past few decades Ever since her husband Bill was elected as US President for the first time in 1993, Hillary's hair has been the subject of serious scrutiny, be it as a result of her choice of scrunchie, the length of her locks, or the shade of her hair. Julia admitted that she is clueless as to why the presidential candidate's hairstyle has been the focus of such intense interest, adding: 'Hair, for some reason, is a really big deal.' And it seems that maintaining her own lengthy locks was certainly a big deal to Julia, who opted to wear a wig while filming the show, instead of chopping her own hair to mirror that of her character. When asked to weigh in on female politicians in general, Julia noted that in her opinion, women in politics appear to be more open than their male counterparts. 'In my limited experience, I would say that female politicians can be a bit more forthcoming, open. I don't mean they're spilling the beans or saying things they shouldn't, but I don't feel a guard in the same way,' she said, adding, 'Maybe it's a female-to-female thing.' Sharp dresser: The 54-year-old actress dons a striped button down and a black pencil skirt in the work-inspired spread As for her character on the show, Julia explained to the magazine that Selina is a 'straddler' whose\u00a0ideology\u00a0revolves around getting 're-elected at all\u00a0costs'. But the actress has no problem playing an 'unlikable character'. 'I don't think we're all so likable all the time,' she explained. 'I include myself in that, and I don't consider myself to be a bad person.' In the fourth season of the hit show, which premiered on Sunday, Julia's Selina has been promoted from Vice President to President after her boss surprisingly steps down. Big group: The entire Veep cast (pictured) came together earlier this month to celebrate the fourth season premiere of their hit political comedy Happy couple: Julia's husband, writer and director Brad Hall, showed his support for his wife at the event And with her change in position, came a change in hair, which Julia also discussed with Page Six, explaining that 'female\u00a0politicians\u00a0get a lot of c**p for their looks'. 'There\u2019s a lot of scrutiny about how female politicians present themselves, so I thought, let\u2019s do something about that,' she said. 'Let\u2019s cut her hair and see what happens, and if it doesn't look good, that\u2019s OK, and if it does look good, that\u2019s OK.' Fans of former Seinfeld star Julia are also buzzing about her upcoming reunion with Jerry Seinfeld. On Tuesday it was announced that she would be making an appearance on her former co-star's Crackle channel web series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.",

        "context": "Glasgow Warriors have confirmed that experienced duo Al Kellock and Dougie Hall will both start Friday night's Guinness PRO12 match with Cardiff Blues at Scotstoun. Both skipper Kellock and Hall - who have played nearly 300 matches between them for the club - are to retire come the end of May and each have a maximum of six outings left of their distinguished professional careers. And while Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend was naming his full squad for the Blues match on Thursday, he announced that the second-row and hooker would start in the pack against the Welsh outfit. Glasgow Warriors veteran Al Kellock will start at lock against Cardiff Blues at Scotstoun on Friday night The encounter is being billed as a tribute to them both and, in a nice touch by the club, the match ball will be presented by Kellock's dad and Hall's mum along with Alistair Johnson, who was Kellock's best man, and Bernie Mitchell, who was an inspirational figure for Hall coming through at Hillhead/Jordanhill. Having been a pro player for 13 years and earned 42 Scotland caps, Hall admits it will be a strange feeling hanging up his boots for good at the end of the current campaign. 'You get to a point where you start thinking to yourself 'this could be the last game of rugby I ever play' so you want to make the most of it,' the 34-year-old said. 'I really want to enjoy these last few games, but also stay focused and help the Warriors secure a play-off place and hopefully the trophy. Glasgow hooker Dougie Hall is hanging up his boots after 13 years of professional rugby As retirement draws closer you do start to think more about the things that you love about the game. You start to think about your last team huddle, the last time you will walk out onto the pitch with your team mates and it is those moments that I will miss incredibly.' Since he first played in the equivalent of the PRO12 for Edinburgh Rugby back in 2002/03 Hall has seen the standard of all of the sides improve incredibly. As a result, despite the fact that the Warriors are first and the Blues are 10th in the table, he does not expect an easy night, far from it. 'They have a number of quality players in their side and a lot of internationals while all of the teams are getting better year on year,' he explained. 'We really have to concentrate on what we are doing ourselves and keep getting results and hopefully that takes care of things and gets us into the play-offs in the coming weeks. 'I hope that gone are the days when the PRO12 is looked on as a lesser league, the teams and the talent involved now really is top class.' Gregor Townsend's Glasgow side are currently top of the Pro12 standings ahead of Cardiff's visit This season Hall has been restricted to seven appearances in the PRO12 for the Warriors to date, Fraser Brown and Pat MacArthur playing the majority of minutes with Kevin Bryce also pushing hard for game time in the number two jersey. And while Hall himself admits that he may not be in the gym as often as the younger trio, he feels the experience he has gained in over 140 match for the club can still help during the league run-in and in the play-offs. 'The last thing you want to do when you have played for all those years is to pick up an injury in the gym,' Hall explained. 'For me now it is all about managing myself throughout the week so that when it comes to getting out on the field I can give it everything. 'As you get older you perhaps become a bit more of a leader in the group, but I like to think I have acted like that since I came to the Warriors in 2007. Wales prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for Cardiff as the loosehead struggles with a calf strain 'I was the starting hooker for a number of years and as Pat, and more recently, Fraser and Kevin have come in I hope they have learnt from watching what I do and also have learnt from what I say too.' Meanwhile, Cardiff Blues prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for the match with a calf strain. The injury forced the Wales and British & Irish Lions' man off last week in his side's European Rugby Challenge Cup quarter-final defeat to the Dragons. 'Gethin has got a calf strain but it is not as bad as we thought. He hasn't trained this week so is a doubt, but he is keen to play a few more games for us yet this season,' Blues attack coach Paul John said. 'We want to play to a game plan, execute well and perform to the best of our ability. To do justice to the league we have to do that. 'Glasgow are a good offloading side, they are a complete side in many ways, and we've got to control the ball better than we did last weekend.'",

Alan Davey controversially laid bare the difficulties of the station's top job in an interview on Radio 4's Feedback programme. Mr Davey was asked about changes to general classical music knowledge over the last 30 years. He said: 'If you look back at the Third Programme (the original name for Radio 3), they were bringing high culture to a relatively mass audience but they could assume that their audience knew everything. 'They did not need to have the ins and outs of classical music explained to them. 'The modern audience might not be getting the same education in music in school as they might have done a few years ago \u2013 not consistently so, anyway. 'We have to perhaps offer more explanation and context for works. 'It's not lowering the standard, it's not making the content simple. It's about how we present it.' Mr Davey, who until January was chief executive of Arts Council England, added: 'I believe there are different ways to draw people into music. 'There's the Classic FM way, and they're very good at that. 'We'll be presenting more longer pieces and greater variety of composers, and we also provide the additional different kinds of music and the cultural commentary throughout.' The station has been accused of 'dumbing down' in the past, especially after a drive in 2011 to make it more 'accessible' to a broader audience. Last year Mr Davey's predecessor Roger Wright (above) dismissed as 'complete nonsense' claims that the station was dumbing down With just two million listeners, Radio 3 is the least listened-to of the BBC's main stations. Last year Mr Davey's predecessor Roger Wright dismissed as 'complete nonsense' claims that the station was dumbing down and said there were distinct differences between the stations. He said: 'I just don't recognise it at all. Apparently we do phone-ins? We don't. 'We haven't had a request show for a long, long time. You do hear one listener voice on the breakfast show suggesting a piece of music \u2014 that's not exactly a phone-in. So it's complete nonsense.'",

While the BBC claimed the plate, which read H982 FKL, was an 'unhappy coincidence', Maria Cristina Barrionuevo said they were deliberately 'provoking people' when they drove it through the country last year. In a report released earlier this week she slammed their actions as 'arrogant and disrespectful'. Scroll down for video A judge has ruled the controversial number plate that led to Jeremy Clarkson and his Top Gear colleagues being thrown out of Argentina was a deliberate reference to the 1982 Falklands War Clarkson and his colleagues fled the South American country last year when their convoy - which was led by a Porsche bearing the controversial number plate - came under attack. A village of Falklands War veterans targeted the team as they drove through Patagonia, with Clarkson claiming in one account that they stormed their hotel. They were accused of deliberately inciting conflict with the plate, an alleged reference to the 1982 Falklands War. Afterwards producers removed the plate and replaced it with another. Investigating whether this was illegal, Mrs Barrionuevo said: 'It should be understood that it is not up to me to investigate or evaluate the decision - arrogant and disrepectful to say the least - by the Top Gear production team to enter the country with one or more Malvinas-referenced number plates. 'Nor is it my job to gauge the reaction - anticipated - of citizens to such an offence. Clarkson (pictured this week) said an angry mob targeted the Top Gear team in their hotel. His producer, Andy Wilman (right), who announced his resignation on Wednesday, denied deliberately using the plate 'My responsibility is to analyse whether a crime has been committed under Argentinian law in relation to the removal from the Porsche of the original number plate H982 FKL and its replacement by another.' Concluding Top Gear chiefs had not acted in 'bad faith' in changing the plates and their hand was forced by 'massive government and popular pressure', she added: 'It led them to remove the original number plate and replace it with another which in principle wouldn't have negative connotations with the aim of ending the main focus of conflict and avoiding violent reactions by locals which indeed ended up taking place. 'The change was not done in a surreptitious way, but with the knowledge and approval of the presenters who participated in meetings with the programme producers.' Local prosecutors have already been informed of the decision and are understood to be preparing an appeal. Judges in the nearby city of Rio Grande - where Clarkson\u2019s Porsche is thought to be in storage - are now expected to be asked to order Clarkson and his pals to be called in for a court grilling by overturning Mrs Barrionuevo's decision. The group's convoy was attacked as they drove through Patagonia. They abandoned the cars in Argentina to flee the country Clarkson, 55, and co-hosts Richard Hammond and James May fled Argentina with a police escort after being told to leave the country as angry Falklands War veterans threatened to kill him. They cut short filming for a Christmas special and took flew to the capital Buenos Aires before returning to Britain. Nearly 30 other members of the film crew were stoned as they headed for Chile by road and had to abandon Clarkson\u2019s Porsche and the cars his co-hosts had driven on a 1,400-mike trip through southern Argentina. The number plate that sparked calls for a full criminal probe - HI VAE - was found on the battered Porsche which was attacked by a furious mob after it was left at the side of the road. A local councillor in Ushuaia later claimed the digits 269 on the number plate of the Ford Mustang Richard Hammond had driven were close to the 255 Britons killed during the war - and the numbers 646 on James May\u2019s Lotus could be taken as a reference to the 649 Argentinian casualties. The furore sparked a diplomatic incident with Argentina\u2019s ambassador Alicia Castro calling the H982 plate 'malicious mockery' of those who fought in the 1982 Falklands War. Andy Wilman, who this week announced he was resigning from the show, insisted it was 'completely untrue' the Clarkson car had been chosen for its number plate or that an alternative plate was substituted for the original one. Clarkson told the Argentinian ambassador she could 'go fooey' ahead of the screening of the Top Gear special last December. The presenters were filming a Christmas special in the South American country last year when the controversy erupted He is now rumoured to be working on a new car show format with Wilman which they are expected to take to a rival British TV channel, Netflix or Amazon. They were spotted in London on Thursday with Richard Hammond and James May, entering Clarkson\u2019s home before leaving together for a drink at a local pub. Hammond, 45, has joined May in confirming he will not return to Top Gear following Clarkson's sacking, insisting yesterday/on Friday he had no plan to 'quit my mates.' Olsin Tymon had his lip split by Clarkson in the March 4 assault and took himself to hospital with his injuries. The incident led to the BBC deciding not to renew Clarkson\u2019s contract after the current Top Gear series finishes. Police investigated the attack but Tymon told them he did not want to press charges and officers announced earlier this month they would \u2018not be pursuing the matter any further.\u2019",

There's seemingly no measure to what can be packed onto the back of a bike or scooter in southeast Asia The Flash Pack's Lee Thompson captured this man with scores of live chickens in weaved baskets this month in Sapa, Vietnam That's one way to pop a wheelie! A man pulls a packed trailer from a loading dock at the Mekong river crossing in Vietnam with a motorbike In this series of images from a single 14-day trip, he photographs a man casually puffing on a cigarette and carrying what looks like more than 20 live chickens in woven cages perched on the back of his scooter\u00a0in Sapa, Vietnam. At a Mekong river crossing in Vietnam he is there to watch a motorcyclist dragging a massive trailer out of a boat loading dock on a bike, with the load so heavy he continuously pops wheelies, all the while not in the slightest bit bothered his two wheels have become one. Thompson enjoys the fact that what looks quirky to a Brit is simply every day life for the locals. In Vietnam alone there are more than 37 million motorbikes or scooters, most definitely the vehicle of choice in traffic that would make western country's peak hours look tame. 'Unlike other tour companies we venture in to remote parts of Sapa where it's not unusual to see bikes carrying livestock like chickens, pigs and goats - it makes really great photographs but it's just a way of life for the locals,' said Thompson. In Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, all that's needed to move some large piles of chairs is two wheels and some clever  packing Getting around on two wheels is a way of life in Vietnam where there are more than 37 million motorbikes (and only a few million cars) 'I watched as one of the bikers tried to work out how he would carry eight goats on his bike, he fell three times before he finally got going and the goats didn't seem to happy about it!' A family of five and a smiling group of four adults pile onto scooters to get from A to B while another transport a giant pile of chairs stacked on a tray from one side of the city to the other with the power of just his humble two-wheeler. With limited resources comes innovation, as is evident with one mother who has attached a cane high chair to the front of her vehicle to make it more comfortable for her to transport her toddler around town in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. 'Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh are full of bikes and it makes the morning commute in London seem easy,' Thompson said. 'Even though most of our group was very well travelled the amount of bikes on the road still comes as a shock in these amazing countries - it's crazy!' A mother fits a high chair is onto the front of a scooter for her toddler in this shot captured in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam A bike that's seen better days carrying pigs is not an unusual sight on the road to Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam, says Thompson A family drive is a cosy affair for this five-some packed onto a scooter  in Hanoi The man on the back of this scooter in Hanoi, Vietnam, holds a ladder and some building materials as they weave their way through traffic Thompson says the eight goats in the cage on the back on this bike 'didn't seem happy' as the rider tipped them over three times The commute in Vietnam makes the daily battle on the Tube that Londoners endure look easy, but they don't seem to mind The morning commute in Ho Chi Minh City is certainly less stuffy than piling into the Tube on a Monday morning And here are some more unique uses for scooters... An assortment of exotic fish are in bags and ready for sale, cleverly attached to this man's scooter, in H\u1ea1 Long Bay, Vietnam A basket vendor balances an array of products on the back of this small motorised bike in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam There's only one way to transport a bike that isn't working in Vietnam ... on the back of one of the country's 37 million bikes or scooters",

        "context": "A series of images capturing the late actor Peter O\u2019Toole on set for the last time have been released in conjunction with today\u2019s release of Fall of an Empire: The Story of Katherine of Alexandria. In the pictures O\u2019Toole, the star of 1962 classic film Lawrence of Arabia, can be seen laughing and joking with fellow cast members despite suffering from a long-term illness that would eventually prove fatal. Fall of an Empire: The Story of Katherine of Alexandria has been dubbed one of the biggest independent films for decades and features Steven Berkoff, Edward Fox, Joss Ackland and Nicole Keniheart alongside O\u2019Toole. Scroll down for video According to Michael Redwood, inevitable wind-ups surfaced 'whenever the devil inside' Peter O'Toole needed entertaining Fall of an Empire: The Story of Katherine of Alexandria attempts to pay homage to Saint Katherine Director Michael Redwood paid tribute to O\u2019Toole. He said: \u2018Peter was certainly not the type to let illness decide over his career, and despite his being poorly at the time of filming, he remained full-on 10 hours a day, showing great interest in the storylines, angles of shots and the lighting.\u2019 He added: \u2018Of course, the inevitable wind-ups surfaced whenever the devil inside him needed entertaining. Fall of an Empire: The Story of Katherine of Alexandria attempts to pay homage to Saint Katherine by portraying her as a real women who experiences fear and torment while remaining steadfast in her beliefs regarding the denouncement of Rome\u2019s enforced pagan worship upon the masses. Director Michael Redwood said Peter O\u2019Toole was certainly not the type to let illness interrupt his career Redwood said: \u2018My agenda was simple: painstaking research, to create an intelligent screenplay and to seek out Britain\u2019s best performers for their unrivalled ability to help portray the story of this religious icon. \u2018The dialogue demanded some of the world\u2019s most recognisable voices such as Peter O\u2019Toole and Edward Fox, who were an inspiration to work with. Katherine\u2019s voice had to be most haunting in its delivery.\u2019 The director also paid tribute to the late actor\u2019s sense of humour and noted that his onscreen chemistry was quickly established with Keniheart on account of the pair discovering that they had both had similar, difficult pasts. Michael Redwood stated that on screen chemistry was quickly established between Peter O'Toole and Nicole Keniheart Director Michael Redwood has a word with Peter O\u2019Toole on the set of\u00a0Fall of an Empire: The Story of Katherine of Alexandria Redwood said: \u2018Peter managed to politely subdue his mischievousness with Keniheart, but not for long, as she well found out when filming an intimate library scene together. \u2018I'd asked Peter to perhaps whisper something to make Ms Keniheart smile after about 30 seconds of a long tracking shot that contained no dialogue, and what he said did indeed make her burst into a grin, but, what he said could never be printed.\u2019 O\u2019Toole enjoyed a long and decorated career and was nominated for a total of eight Academy Awards, received an honorary Oscar, and won four Golden Globes. Fall of an Empire: The Story of Katherine of Alexandria is available in cinemas and can be purchased on DVD starting today.

A Walmart employee is also seen trying to aid police and throws a punch in a bid to subdue the band members.

Matthew 24 is a Bible verse dealing with the end of times Fatal: One member of the Gaver family was killed in the shootout, now identified as Enoch Gaver. When police arrived on the scene, the Gavers 'immediately' started attacking, according to the Arizona DPS According to Facebook, the family is part of a band called 'Matthew 24 Now' (they are also go by 'Busking in the Son' back in Idaho). The name refers to a Biblical passage dealing with the end of times. The remaining members of the Gaver family have been jailed, including an 11-year-old and 15-year-old who were sent to a juvenile detention facility. On duty: Cottonwood Police Sgt Jeremy Daniels, 31 (pictured), was shot in the leg during the attack but is expected to make a full recovery. One of the suspects, David Gaver, was shot in the abdomen but has since been released from hospital The Arizona Department of Public Safety, who are investigating the shooting, said it was sparked when a few members of the Gaver family went into the Walmart to use the bathroom, and one of the store employees followed them into the restroom. At least one member of the Gaver family shoved the female employee, which led to the store calling 911. When police arrived on the scene to investigate the incident, they found the Gavers in the parking lot where they had been living out of a large SUV for the past few days. When police arrived on the scene to investigate the incident, they found the Gavers in the parking lot where they had been living out of a large SUV for the past few days. DPS spokesman Bart Graves says when the police arrived, the Gavers 'immediately' started attacking, according to AZ Central. Witness Louie Solano told KPHO that the fight 'looked like a riot in the middle of the parking lot'. 'Lots of screams. Just screeching noise, like unreal, unreal,' Solano said. 'During the course of the fight, we believe there was a struggle for the officer's gun,' Graves said. That's when three shots were fired, though it's not clear who had the gun at that point. Sgt Daniels was shot in the leg, while David Gaver was hit in the abdomen. A Walmart employee who came to the aid of police suffered a sprained arm and cuts in the fight. Other officers were treated for lacerations, bruises and a twisted ankle.

        "context": "A teacher has been banned from the classroom after he let pupils change their exam answers invalidating his whole school's SATs results. Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds, which assess English, maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury, Gloucestershire. This was despite the exam session finishing, a conduct panel heard. Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, pictured, to make the changes to their SATs exam answers The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off. After the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year, the hearing was told. Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school's SAT's results after a probe by the local education authority (file picture) However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. But the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher\u2019s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour. 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority.' Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years. He said: 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. 'Mr Guffick\u2019s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress. 'In all the circumstances, I agree with the panel\u2019s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction. 'Mr Guffick has shown remorse and insight and he deeply regrets his actions.' He was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the High Court.",
