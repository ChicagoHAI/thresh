For a little adventure, she sprinkles on some Parmesan and red pepper flakes. Before the coronavirus pandemic swept across the country, Ms. Reninger, a criminology student at Northern Arizona University who also works at a dog day-care facility, estimated that she ate pizza only once every couple of months. That changed late last summer when she strolled into a Slice and Ice pizza parlor.",

Millions of Americans remain unemployed, and the systems we have in place to help have failed many of them. But if you squint, there is a silver lining for some: More Americans have been able to save money and pay off debt since lockdowns across the country have meant less travel, less entertainment and less dining out. For those lucky enough to be in such a position, possibly even for the first time, the next question is: What should I do with it, especially once life has returned to \u201cnormal\u201d?",

Then she pulled up a QR code for the digital currency from inside her bank app, which the store scanned for payment. \u201cThe journey of how you pay, it\u2019s very similar\u201d to that of other Chinese payments apps, Ms. Huang said of the eCNY experience.",

But figuring out how to regulate it is tricky. So far, that has meant an all-or-nothing approach. City Councils in Oakland, Portland, San Francisco, Minneapolis and elsewhere have banned police use of the technology, largely because of bias in how it works.",
