A lion and its cub enjoy a tender moment together. The lion's paws rest on top of the front paws of its cub, who lays its head on its mother. A polar bear embraces her cub. Polar bears care for their cubs until they're about two years old, when the cubs venture out on their own. A kangaroo rubs her cheek on her joey's hand.",

Of course, it's only a guess. And, in itself, that doesn't mean prices will rise in New York.",

In December, Education Week reported that schools were seeing \u201cdramatic increases in the number of failing or near-failing grades\u201d on report cards. A major symptom of school disengagement is not turning in homework, a problem that can easily snowball.

That changed late last summer when she strolled into a Slice and Ice pizza parlor.",
